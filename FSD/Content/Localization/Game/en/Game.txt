Deep Rock Galactic has now been in the wild for 1 week. We have finished celebrating the awesome launch (yeah!) and are now hard at work getting new updates out and planning the future. Inside the game, we have a nice feedback button, and a big thanks to the thousands of you who have already taken advantage of this. It’s an extremely big help.
The feedback tells us we are definitely on to something good here, but it’s equally clear we have some we also hot topics that need some immediate love. First iteration of Key Bindings went in through the previous patch, and this time we have focused on fixes for the Kick feature, tweaks to the Driller and fixing Bosco's inability to kill Cave Leeches. All of these and MANY more are in the new update. You can scroll down and see all the patch notes below. 

--- Driller Buffs ---
The Driller is probably the most unique class in Deep Rock Galactic, so we were sad to see our iconic drilldozer valued below the other three classes in usefulness. Therefore, we have tweaked both his Flamethrower and Drills. In the detailed patch notes below, you can see the exact stat changes, which might also give you some hints on how to better utilize the Driller.

--- Payout on Mission Failed & Kicking ---
Two issues pretty quickly started to show themselves: Dissatisfaction with the way we’ve handled a Mission Failed scenario in regards to payout, and the fact that players could be kicked from the team at any given time. We’ve worked out a first pass on a solution for both these, as listed below:

Firstly, it used to be that failing a mission meant NO payout at all. Now, failing a mission will give you a compensation of 25% of the minerals stored in Molly at the time of the mission ending. 

Secondly, getting Kicked from a team will result in a Mission Failed case, where you will receive compensation based on what was added to Molly since you joined that session. 

It is now no longer possible to Join or being Kicked from a team once the Drop Pod has been called and the final countdown has begun. This is a test for now and we’ll monitor the outcome - and it’s a pretty easy fix, so we can quickly backpedal if needed.

Also, it is extremely important to understand how Mission Complete works. You might think that the rewards are split out between survivors. They are not. We calculate the total and then each player in the session gets that same reward, regardless of the size of the team. On top of this, each surviving player adds a Survivor Bonus, which has been boosted also. “Leave No Dwarf Behind” should be the ethos here - the more players manage to get out alive, the greater the bonus for all involved!




We have elected not to implement vote-kicking with this update, despite some players asking for it. It’s a fair bit of work to implement, and we are not completely convinced it is the way to go at this point. That said, there are good arguments both for and against this feature, and we will continue to monitor the situation. The same goes for a vote button on Molly. 

--- Bosco ---
Detailed in the patch notes below, Bosco has received a fairly significant buff, and his ability to kill Cave Leeches should have been improved. We write “should” since this issue will need further work to squash fully, but it should at least be a better experience all round now.

--- Trading Cards ---
This one is a bit embarrassing. Turns out you have to manually have to publish the Trading Cards when you launch a new game on Steam. Whoops. The good news is that they are implemented now and await harvesting!


--- Roadmap ---
Midweek, we had a big feedback meeting here at the Ghost Ship office. We’ve gathered all the feedback from you, the players, as well as feedback from the dev team and our partners. There are SO MANY cool things we can and will do to expand Deep Rock Galactic. Task for now is to choose which ones go in the game, and in which order, and we plan to reveal a greater and more comprehensive road map for the coming months over the next few weeks.
