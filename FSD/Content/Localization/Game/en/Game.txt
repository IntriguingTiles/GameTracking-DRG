Deep Rock Galactic has now been in the wild for 1 week. We have finished celebrating the awesome launch (yeah!) and are now hard at work getting new updates out. Inside the game, we have a nice feedback button, and a big thanks to the thousands of you who have already taken advantage of this. It’s an extremely big help. Below, you can read about the update.

--- Driller Buffs ---
The Driller is probably the most unique class in Deep Rock Galactic, so we were sad to see our iconic drilldozer valued below the other three classes in usefulness. Therefore, we have tweaked both his Flamethrower and Drills. In the detailed patch notes below, you can see the exact stat changes, which might also give you some hints on how to better utilize the Driller.

--- Payout on Mission Failed & Kicking ---
Two issues pretty quickly started to show themselves: Dissatisfaction with the way we’ve handled a Mission Failed scenario in regards to payout, and the fact that players could be kicked from the team at any given time. We’ve worked out a first pass on a solution for both these, as listed below:

Firstly, it used to be that failing a mission meant NO payout at all. Now, failing a mission will give you a compensation of 25% of the minerals stored in Molly at the time of the mission ending. 

Secondly, getting Kicked from a team will result in a Mission Failed case, where you will receive compensation based on what was added to Molly since you joined that session. 

It is now no longer possible to Join or being Kicked from a team once the Drop Pod has been called and the final countdown has begun. This is a test for now and we’ll monitor the outcome - and it’s a pretty easy fix, so we can quickly backpedal if needed.

Also, it is extremely important to understand how Mission Complete works. You might think that the rewards are split out between survivors. They are not. We calculate the total and then each player in the session gets that same reward, regardless of the size of the team. On top of this, each surviving player adds a Survivor Bonus, which has been boosted also. “Leave No Dwarf Behind” should be the ethos here - the more players manage to get out alive, the greater the bonus for all involved!


We have elected not to implement vote-kicking with this update, despite some players asking for it. It’s a fair bit of work to implement, and we are not completely convinced it is the way to go at this point. That said, there are good arguments both for and against this feature, and we will continue to monitor the situation. The same goes for a vote button on Molly. 

--- Bosco ---
Detailed in the patch notes below, Bosco has received a fairly significant buff, and his ability to kill Cave Leeches should have been improved. We write “should” since this issue will need further work to squash fully, but it should at least be a better experience all round now.

--- Trading Cards ---
This one is a bit embarrassing. Turns out you have to manually have to publish the Trading Cards when you launch a new game on Steam. Whoops. The good news is that they are implemented now and await harvesting!


--- Roadmap ---
Midweek, we had a big feedback meeting here at the Ghost Ship office. We’ve gathered all the feedback from you, the players, as well as feedback from the dev team and our partners. There are SO MANY cool things we can and will do to expand Deep Rock Galactic. Task for now is to choose which ones go in the game, and in which order, and we plan to reveal a greater and more comprehensive road map for the coming months over the next few weeks.

"
	Update_15 = "Hello Miners! 
Before we head out for a couple of weeks of sorely needed summer vacation, we have cooked up a lovely little mutation to the game for you all!

--- PATCH NOTES ---

MUTATOR SYSTEM
----------------------------
From now on, all missions have a chance to appear with Mutators attached to them. They come in two variants: Warnings and Anomalies. Anomalies are neutral or even positive, while Warnings will severely increase the danger you’ll face. Missions with Warnings on them also add a substantial Hazard Bonus to the final score. Look on the mission map for the new Warning and Anomaly icons!

The following Warnings and Anomalies are already implemented, and we expect to add lots more in future patches.

WARNINGS:

- EXPLODER INFESTATION: Whatever mutation affects the Glyphid Exploders, this is likely one of the epicenters! Hordes of ‘roided-up, rabid Glyphid Exploders will do their best to turn you into a fine red mist.

- SHIELD DISRUPTION: The cave is heavily electrostatically charged. And wouldn’t you know it, it makes your shield generators short out. So...no shields!

- MACTERA PLAGUE: Macteras of all kinds have completely taken over this cave! Flying horror descends from the sky! You could say it’s going to be... Macterrible!
 
- CAVE LEECH CLUSTERS: If you have a phobia of Cave Leeches, this cave will either cure you or confirm your worst fears...

ANOMALIES:

- GOLD RUSH: This cave has extraordinarily rich deposits of gold; huge veins of it just waiting for the sweet caress of your pickaxe!
 
- MINERAL MANIA: Crafting Minerals galore! It is the reason to go to Hoxxes after all.

- TRIPLE XP: 10 credits says you can’t guess what it does...

- LOW GRAVITY: Jump vast chasms! Scale nearly vertical walls! Just keep in mind... fall damage is still a thing, so don’t get TOO cocky...

- CRITICAL WEAKNESS: Multikill! Aim for the weak spots for severely increased damage!

- GOLDEN BUGS: Each kill earns gold for the team!

- RICH ATMOSPHERE: You feel energized and can move faster around. Your beautiful voice may appear slightly altered by the rich atmosphere, Chipmunk!


TERRAIN SCANNER - NOW IN 3D!
----------------------------
The ol’ flat Terrain Scanner has had an overhaul! The camera is now fully rotatable and zoomable, and you’ll have a much easier time finding where you need to go. Terrain Scanner has been mapped to both [TAB] and [M] by default. Go try it out! 


VANITY UPDATES
----------------------------
DYE YOUR HAIR OR DIE DYEING!
For Update 14, we experimented briefly with locking hair colors to classes, to make them stand out more. It turns out the players didn’t enjoy that too much... in fact, we practically feared being strung up like elves! Rejoice, however! Custom hair colors are back, and are even a bit more advanced now!

MORE HEADWEAR ADDED
A couple of new hairdos have been added (The Franklin and The Gamekeeper), as well as a bunch of much-requested variations to some of the hats and helmets!

TAKE YOUR DWARF FOR A SPIN!
Ever wondered what your dwarf looks like from behind? Well, you can now rotate your dwarf in all the relevant menus!

Note: For those who wondered where all your armor went after Update 14, it was down to a massive reworking of the system we use for all the Vanity items. All those affected should have gotten all the credits and minerals you spent on them back.


BOSCO UPDATES
----------------------------
AN EVEN BETTER BOSCO
Bosco has had a brain upgrade and should now be much better at doing what he’s told and dishing out damage. He is so good that we had to tweak down his damage from 8 to 6 per bullet. His burst fire has also been adjusted to be a bit slower.

RETURN OF THE DRONE
When starting a multiplayer game solo, Bosco joins you until another player joins. If that player drops out again, Bosco will reappear!


SERVER IMPROVEMENTS
----------------------------
EASY FRIEND INVITE
Invite your friends directly into your game! And you don’t even have to have set up a mission yet!

JOIN FRIENDS UNINVITED 
You can always join your friend’s game - unless they already have a full team that is!

SEE FULL SERVERS
The Server List didn’t show full servers before - it does now!


MISC.
----------------------------
REGENERATING HEALTH
Health will regenerate to a specific minimum after taking massive damage. No more running around with 1 hit point!

MINIGUN UPDATE
The Minigun has had a massive overhaul, with a snazzy new model, improved animations, and new particles. After firing the Minigun, the accuracy is reduced at a slower rate.

LOOK WHO’S TALKING NOW
An icon is shown next to a player’s icon when using voice chat.

HUD IT LIKE YOU WANT
Some aspects of the HUD can now be hidden through the Options. For now, Enemy Health Bars, the Compass, your depth, Player Name, Class, and Class Icon.

SALVAGE OPERATION TWEAKS
- Uplink and Fuels Cells have gotten new models and animations.
- Escape Pod powering up time reduced from 120 seconds to 90 seconds.

PERKS, BUFFS, AND NERFS
- Increased the sprint speed bonus of the Weekend Athlete perk.
- Rank 3 Field Medic Perk will send nearby Glyphids fleeing when you finish reviving a teammate.
- Rank 5 Resupplier Perk will auto-reload all your weapons when you resupply.
- Fixed grammar and typos on several Perks and Milestones.
- Red Sugar Rocks: Max rank will give you a 20% speed boost for ten secs. 


"
	Update_14 = "Hello Miners! This time around we’ve cooked up a fairly massive update together for you, just in time for summer vacation. And speaking of summer vacation - DRG just cancelled yours! New missions and monsters await and you got a ton of milestones to meet! So get to work!

MAJOR NEW FEATURES
------------------------------------
NEW MISSION TYPE: SALVAGE OPERATION
It is your job to go in and clean up after a failed mining expedition. You will have to salvage three Mini Mules and repair a damaged drop pod in order to bring all the lost equipment home. Get ready for a combat heavy experience where teamwork and good preparation is key to success! Don’t be another failure!

NEW ENEMY: THE MACTERA GRABBER
The Grabber is the new terror from the sky. It snatches up a random dwarf and flies away with him, before dropping him to crack like a nut on the floor below! Depending on your luck, you might just end up with some bruises - or you might end up being dumped into a chasm! Shoot ‘em quick, that’s our suggestion...

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Deep Rock Galactic are now tracking your work performance! On the KPI screen in your cabin you can check out detailed stats on your performance, you can reach milestones and earn perk points, and you can spend those points on unlocking awesome perks for your dwarves, making your day to day work a little easier.

IMPROVED VANITY CUSTOMIZATION SYSTEM 
The Vanity System has had a complete overhaul, expanding greatly on our options. Here are some of the new features:
- Build the beard of your dreams! Individually customize hair, eyebrows, sideburns, moustache and beard!  
- All armor has received an overhaul! More detail has been added in general, and armor now supports textures! Look at the nice tiger stripes on the Gunner’s armor!
- The original selection of beards has been broken up into parts and added back in to support the new system. 
-  A small selection of new Hats, Hair, Helmets, Beards, Moustaches, and Sideburns have been added. We are by no means done here yet, this was just what we managed to get in for this patch.

NEW ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS
- During missions in the Sandblasted Corridors, you will now have a chance of  encountering blinding sandstorms and forceful wind tunnels. 
- The Magma Core just got a lot hotter! Try to avoid the hot magma rock - It burns! Also notice that explosions will expose the hot magma rock under the surface - turning the battlezone into a dangerous place for friends and foes.  

BUFFS AND NERFS
------------------------------------
ENGINEER: PLATFORM GUN
- Start ammo increased from 10 to 12 platforms. 
- Mag size increased from 3 to 4 platforms.

ENGINEER: SENTRY GUNS
- Starting sentry gun max ammo increased from 400 to 425.
- Damage per bullet has been decreased from 7 to 5.5.
- You can now upgrade max ammo for the sentry guns. The upgrade gives +75 max ammo - making you reach a total max ammo capacity of 500.

- Clip size upgrade has been increased from +4 bullets to +6 bullets.

"
	Update_16 = "Hello miners! We’re back in the saddle after some lovely summer vacation and have cranked out a new patch for you. In response to all the hot weather we’ve been having, we figured the obvious thing to do was add an ice biome. Right?

--- PATCH NOTES ---

NEW BIOME - GLACIAL STRATA
----------------------------
Brave an all new icy hellscape, complete with unstable and deadly ice spikes in the ceiling, terrifying crevices opening up under your feet, exclusive enemy types, and the first iteration of our all new Temperature system! Play it cool - just be careful you don’t end up as a meat popsicle...

CAVES
- Ice! The main material of the Glacial Strata planetary region is ice instead of rock, so fire melts it! Use this information wisely.
- Deep snow! Look out for piles of it. It won’t harm you, but it’ll slow you down and is  impossible to sprint through.
- Frozen lakes! Watch your step - they’re quite slippery.
- Hot Springs! The only relief from the biting cold, if you disregard the “tools” you carry with you.

FLORA
- Explosive Ice Plants! Use them to freeze aliens in their tracks, but watch yourself...they’re just as likely to hit you as the enemy.
- Platform Plants! Shoot them to release the liquid inside - it will freeze instantly and form useful (but brittle) platforms for you to use.

ENEMIES
- Ice Bomber! A variation of our brand new Mactera Bomber enemy. It’ll release sickening streams of freezing substance as it flies past you.
- Frost Glyphids! Several types of Glyphid have adapted to the cold and will continue to hunt you for your lovely warm flesh even here. And watch out for the Frost Praetorian - it’s a stone cold killer. On the upside, they all seem quite susceptible to heat of any kind…

HAZARDS
- Cold Vents! Watch out for cracks in the walls and telltale horisontal streams of air - occasionally, they’ll let out blasts of bone-chilling wind.
- Thin Ice! Walk carefully and keep your ears peeled. Deep chasms might just open up beneath you at a moment’s notice.
- Unstable Icicles! Keep an eye out for algae-filled icicles in the ceiling. The slightest disturbance tends to make them fall thunderously to the floor and shatter. Woe be to any that stand underneath them at that point.

TEMPERATURE SYSTEM
- While body odour remains low on the list of dwarven priorities, keeping an eye on your body temperature is now more important than ever. Get too low and you’ll get frozen in place. Get too high and you’ll burst into flame. Keeping towards the center of the scale is safest. 
- Certain actions or items will reduce or increase your temperature. Some, such as the flamethrower, is pretty self-explanatory.
- Enemies follow the same rules. They can be both frozen and set on fire, though they’ll have unique resistances or weaknesses depending on their species. FYI: Frozen enemies can be shattered if enough damage are applied to them...

OTHER ADDITIONS / TWEAKS
----------------------------
DISCORD RICH INTEGRATION
- See what your friends are playing and join their game directly from Discord.

ENEMIES
- New Enemy type: Goo Bomber
- The Spitball Infector now starts dormant, and only wakes up if you get too close or it is injured in any way.
- Mactera Spawns have become much weaker to melee attacks.
- Mactera Grabber should no longer scream unless it’s actively chasing you.

BOSCO
- New icon so you always know what Bosco is up to.
- Bosco no longer mine dirt that is closer to the Player than the wall instructed to mine at.
- Bosco now always goes for the Grabber / Cave leech that grabbed the Player.
- Bosco will not revive the Player without being near him/her after getting killed by a Cave leech or Grabber.
- Tweaked Bosco’s priorities - he’ll now focus on the enemies instead of mining when instructed to.
- Optimization while pointing at enemies.

AUDIO
- Tons of new voice lines added.

FIXES
----------------------------
- Fixed Scout IFG Grenade not applying the proper damage resistance penalty.
- Fixed Molly choosing to walk away while someone is depositing. Manners, Molly!
- Improved the way savegames are handled - your savegames are now named after your SteamID to prevent problems when sharing a single machine.
- Backups are now written to seperate files each session to prevent save game corruption from accidentally trashing the backups.
- Fixed an issue with Ziplines where clients could move slightly and increase speed while on the zip line.
- Fixed framerate drop when pointing the laser pointer at Glyphid tunnels and embedded minerals.
- Enemies should no longer continue making sounds after they’re dead. Stands to reason, really…
- Mactera Spawn and Grabber should no longer get stuck outside the Navmesh after dashing.
"
	Update_12 = "Hey Miners!

It’s patch time again, and we have a bunch of cool new stuff for you! Tweaks, bug fixes, and the first new enemy! Also, along with these smaller updates, we are now initiating some larger content and feature development. More on this later, when we reveal a larger roadmap of things to come. 

--- PATCH NOTES ---

COMMUNITY REQUESTED FIXES
-----------------------------------------------------

BOSCO JOINS YOU IF YOU START A HOSTED GAME ALONE
A very popular request from the community has been for Bosco to accompany you when you start hosting a game. This way you can start mining with Bosco assisting you, while you wait for your friends or strangers to join your game. We have done a rough first implementation with no bells and whistles, and it works like this:
- Bosco joins you when you start hosting a public/ private game and head in alone.
- When the first a player joins your game, Bosco will self-destruct for that game session.

JADIZ BUFF
Jadiz has been one of the hardest crafting materials to collect and we have buffed it. Jadiz will now spawn a bit more often in Crystalline Caverns Region and we have changed the value range of it from 7-18 to 10-18. 

WANT NICE CLEAN SCREEN SHOTS? 
Some of you have been requesting been able to take nice clean screenshot and we actually also need that feature! Now you can Hold [H] to toggle the HUD on/off. 


NEW STUFF
-----------------------------------------------------

NEW ENEMY: SAY HELLO TO THE MACTERA SPAWN! 
The Mactera Spawn is our first proper flying enemy. It will attack from a distance using its vomit attack. Smack that Fly!

SWARMER TUNNELS 
You can now come across strangely looking small tunnels coming out of the walls. Glyphid Swarmers live here! They are very territorial and will aggressively defend their nest! A simple advice: Avoid them!  

CAVE LEECH LETS YOU GO “GENTLY” WHEN IT DIES! 
Previously, when a dwarf was dropped from a dying Cave Leech, he might drop for a long distance, mysteriously taking no fall damage, which was as designed but seemed weird. Now the Cave Leech slackens its’ tongue and lowers you down more gently, making it seem more realistic that you don’t take fall damage.

DESTRUCTIBLE ARMOR ON GLYPHIDS!
Direct enough firepower to those pesky armor plates to shoot them off and expose the soft underbits underneath!

NEW PASSIVE CREATURE: IS IT A PLANE? IS IT A BIRD? NO IT‘S A FLYING JELLYFISH! 
The Dense Biozone region of Hoxxes is now inhabited by large, passive, flying jellies.

MINERAL TRADE TERMINAL 
In the Mineral Trade Terminal you can trade your credits for crafting materials, but be advised that materials are priced fairly exorbitantly. You can also sell your precious crafting materials for credits, but again don’t expect a fair price. Deep Rock Galactic are always trying to maximize their income even if it comes from its workers! 

REVOLVER RELOAD ANIMATION
The Gunner’s Revolver now has a proper reload animation - as well as a cool gunslinger move when you try the reload while it’s fully reloaded.  

FLASHLIGHT NERF 
Range on the dwarves’ flashlights has been tweaked down from 12.50m to 11.00m, making them a bit weaker.

PATHFINDER IMPROVEMENTS
Enemies are now less likely to go straight through thin cave walls.

M.U.L.E. SAFETY FIX
If for some reason the MULE does not find its way back to the Escape Pod, the doors will still open 15 seconds before countdown runs out.  

...And tons of minor stuff, mostly bug-fixes behind the scenes, but also small visual upgrades. For full overview see the patch notes below.

	Update_13 = "Hey Miners!

It’s that time again, and we have some interesting changes for you to enjoy! This Update is more experimental than usual with tweaks to the health system and we would love to hear your opinions. 

--- PATCH NOTES ---

COMMUNITY REQUESTED FIXES
-----------------------------------------------------

LESS SHIELD
Some of you hardcore miners have been requesting that the game was harder - especially on higher difficulties. We have tried to make tweaks that makes the game harder on higher difficulties, but feel almost the same on lower difficulties. We have lowered your starting shield from 30 to 25 and changed the shield upgrades to the shield from 10 to 2.5 (giving a 10% boost).

MORE HEALTH
To compensate for the lack of shield - we’ve increased player health from 100 to 110 hp. 

MORE RED SUGAR
Furthermore the amount of healing you get from red sugar has been increased 25% and the amount of red sugar spawned in a mission has been increased by 10%. 


TWEAKS 
-----------------------------------------------------

SOLO ENEMY NUMBERS & HEALTH
Exploring the caves of Hoxxes by yourself takes more time and can be brutal, so we have made it so the swarms will be a little bit smaller when you are on your own. Enemy health has also been lowered a little bit for solo expeditions. The creatures of Hoxxes are still dangerous so don’t drop your guard!  

BOSCO NOW WITH 50% MORE REVIVES
While he really wants to, Bosco can’t always save you from a cave leech. He feels really bad about it and has requested that he be allowed to revive you 3 times instead of 2. The request has been granted.

MACTERA SPAWN HEALTH INCREASED
In a continuing effort to perfect the Mactera Spawn we have changed its health from 180 to 210. Remember to use cover and aim for the weak-spot!

We have another update for you with some cool new features, some tweaks and some bug fixes. Along with these smaller updates, we are now initiating some larger content and feature development. More on this later, when we reveal a larger roadmap of things to come.

COMMUNITY REQUESTED FIXES 
--------------------------------------------
GUNNER: GATLING GUN REWORK
There’s a been a lot of talk about the Gatling Gun being too weak especially on higher difficulties. We agree, and we have made a bunch of tweaks to it:
- Starting Ammo Capacity changed from 1800 to 1600 rounds.
- It is now fed ammo continuously from a single, upgradeable ammo drum - no more reloading!
- Overheats slightly faster - tweaked from 10 seconds of continuous fire to 9.
- Overheating is more punishing - time to cool down raised from 8 seconds to 10
- Upgrades reworked: Upgrades involving ammo and clip increase have now been made to only focus on the clip size. First upgrade originally gave you +400 bullets to max ammo it has been changed to +400 to clipsize. Second clip upgrade will give you a total boost of +400 bullets where it before only increased the clipsize. Resulting in the Gatling Gun packing impressive 2400 bullets when maxed out!  
- New Tungsten Bullet upgrade for Gatling Gun has been added allowing you to boost the damage 25%. A mandatory upgrade for players with affinity for Extreme difficulty.
- Added smoke effect to make it more obvious when you overheats

A BETTER BOSCO
If you pointed at a really tiny chunk of unmined minerals Bosco would go there and not find the tiny chunk then abort the task. Now he can find the chunk and dig it. Bosco is also much better at not sneaking up in front of you when you are mining. All quality of life fixes to you favorite drone!


NEW STUFF
--------------------------------------------
TEAM CAMS LET YOU STAY IN THE ACTION
1st iteration of Team Cams - Keep an eye on your teammates are doing while you are incapacitated. Now it is less of a downer being down! 

ELECTRO CRYSTALS
Deadly Electro Crystals have been added to Crystal Caverns. Don’t get too close - they pack a punch!

PLATFORMS PROHIBITED IN DROP POD  
Platforms (and Supply Pods) can not spawn/ attach to drop pod anymore. We get it... some off you had fun filling up the Drop Pod with platforms, but Management reminds you that Platform Concrete is notoriously hard to clean out!

GRAVITY RECALIBRATION
A temptingly tantalizing button called “Gravity Recalibration” has been activated on the Space Rig. Management will likely frown on employees abusing it - but it’s so big and red...

FIXED STEAM REGION SEARCH
Before some people had a hard time finding games in their own region. We have fixed this now (we hope)!

...And tons of minor stuff, mostly bug-fixes behind the scenes, but also small visual upgrades. For full overview see the patch notes below.
