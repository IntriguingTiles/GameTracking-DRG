Deep Rock Galactic has now been in the wild for 1 week. We have finished celebrating the awesome launch (yeah!) and are now hard at work getting new updates out. Inside the game, we have a nice feedback button, and a big thanks to the thousands of you who have already taken advantage of this. It’s an extremely big help. Below, you can read about the update.

--- Driller Buffs ---
The Driller is probably the most unique class in Deep Rock Galactic, so we were sad to see our iconic drilldozer valued below the other three classes in usefulness. Therefore, we have tweaked both his Flamethrower and Drills. In the detailed patch notes below, you can see the exact stat changes, which might also give you some hints on how to better utilize the Driller.

--- Payout on Mission Failed & Kicking ---
Two issues pretty quickly started to show themselves: Dissatisfaction with the way we’ve handled a Mission Failed scenario in regards to payout, and the fact that players could be kicked from the team at any given time. We’ve worked out a first pass on a solution for both these, as listed below:

Firstly, it used to be that failing a mission meant NO payout at all. Now, failing a mission will give you a compensation of 25% of the minerals stored in Molly at the time of the mission ending. 

Secondly, getting Kicked from a team will result in a Mission Failed case, where you will receive compensation based on what was added to Molly since you joined that session. 

It is now no longer possible to Join or being Kicked from a team once the Drop Pod has been called and the final countdown has begun. This is a test for now and we’ll monitor the outcome - and it’s a pretty easy fix, so we can quickly backpedal if needed.

Also, it is extremely important to understand how Mission Complete works. You might think that the rewards are split out between survivors. They are not. We calculate the total and then each player in the session gets that same reward, regardless of the size of the team. On top of this, each surviving player adds a Survivor Bonus, which has been boosted also. “Leave No Dwarf Behind” should be the ethos here - the more players manage to get out alive, the greater the bonus for all involved!


We have elected not to implement vote-kicking with this update, despite some players asking for it. It’s a fair bit of work to implement, and we are not completely convinced it is the way to go at this point. That said, there are good arguments both for and against this feature, and we will continue to monitor the situation. The same goes for a vote button on Molly. 

--- Bosco ---
Detailed in the patch notes below, Bosco has received a fairly significant buff, and his ability to kill Cave Leeches should have been improved. We write “should” since this issue will need further work to squash fully, but it should at least be a better experience all round now.

--- Trading Cards ---
This one is a bit embarrassing. Turns out you have to manually have to publish the Trading Cards when you launch a new game on Steam. Whoops. The good news is that they are implemented now and await harvesting!


--- Roadmap ---
Midweek, we had a big feedback meeting here at the Ghost Ship office. We’ve gathered all the feedback from you, the players, as well as feedback from the dev team and our partners. There are SO MANY cool things we can and will do to expand Deep Rock Galactic. Task for now is to choose which ones go in the game, and in which order, and we plan to reveal a greater and more comprehensive road map for the coming months over the next few weeks.

	Update_12 = "Hey Miners!

It’s patch time again, and we have a bunch of cool new stuff for you! Tweaks, bug fixes, and the first new enemy! Also, along with these smaller updates, we are now initiating some larger content and feature development. More on this later, when we reveal a larger roadmap of things to come. 

--- PATCH NOTES ---

COMMUNITY REQUESTED FIXES
-----------------------------------------------------

BOSCO JOINS YOU IF YOU START A HOSTED GAME ALONE
A very popular request from the community has been for Bosco to accompany you when you start hosting a game. This way you can start mining with Bosco assisting you, while you wait for your friends or strangers to join your game. We have done a rough first implementation with no bells and whistles, and it works like this:
- Bosco joins you when you start hosting a public/ private game and head in alone.
- When the first a player joins your game, Bosco will self-destruct for that game session.

JADIZ BUFF
Jadiz has been one of the hardest crafting materials to collect and we have buffed it. Jadiz will now spawn a bit more often in Crystalline Caverns Region and we have changed the value range of it from 7-18 to 10-18. 

WANT NICE CLEAN SCREEN SHOTS? 
Some of you have been requesting been able to take nice clean screenshot and we actually also need that feature! Now you can Hold [H] to toggle the HUD on/off. 


NEW STUFF
-----------------------------------------------------

NEW ENEMY: SAY HELLO TO THE MACTERA SPAWN! 
The Mactera Spawn is our first proper flying enemy. It will attack from a distance using its vomit attack. Smack that Fly!

SWARMER TUNNELS 
You can now come across strangely looking small tunnels coming out of the walls. Glyphid Swarmers live here! They are very territorial and will aggressively defend their nest! A simple advice: Avoid them!  

CAVE LEECH LETS YOU GO “GENTLY” WHEN IT DIES! 
Previously, when a dwarf was dropped from a dying Cave Leech, he might drop for a long distance, mysteriously taking no fall damage, which was as designed but seemed weird. Now the Cave Leech slackens its’ tongue and lowers you down more gently, making it seem more realistic that you don’t take fall damage.

DESTRUCTIBLE ARMOR ON GLYPHIDS!
Direct enough firepower to those pesky armor plates to shoot them off and expose the soft underbits underneath!

NEW PASSIVE CREATURE: IS IT A PLANE? IS IT A BIRD? NO IT‘S A FLYING JELLYFISH! 
The Dense Biozone region of Hoxxes is now inhabited by large, passive, flying jellies.

MINERAL TRADE TERMINAL 
In the Mineral Trade Terminal you can trade your credits for crafting materials, but be advised that materials are priced fairly exorbitantly. You can also sell your precious crafting materials for credits, but again don’t expect a fair price. Deep Rock Galactic are always trying to maximize their income even if it comes from its workers! 

REVOLVER RELOAD ANIMATION
The Gunner’s Revolver now has a proper reload animation - as well as a cool gunslinger move when you try the reload while it’s fully reloaded.  

FLASHLIGHT NERF 
Range on the dwarves’ flashlights has been tweaked down from 12.50m to 11.00m, making them a bit weaker.

PATHFINDER IMPROVEMENTS
Enemies are now less likely to go straight through thin cave walls.

M.U.L.E. SAFETY FIX
If for some reason the MULE does not find its way back to the Escape Pod, the doors will still open 15 seconds before countdown runs out.  

...And tons of minor stuff, mostly bug-fixes behind the scenes, but also small visual upgrades. For full overview see the patch notes below.

It’s that time again, and we have some interesting changes for you to enjoy! This Update is more experimental than usual with tweaks to the health system and we would love to hear your opinions. 

--- PATCH NOTES ---

COMMUNITY REQUESTED FIXES
-----------------------------------------------------

LESS SHIELD
Some of you hardcore miners have been requesting that the game was harder - especially on higher difficulties. We have tried to make tweaks that makes the game harder on higher difficulties, but feel almost the same on lower difficulties. We have lowered your starting shield from 30 to 25 and changed the shield upgrades to the shield from 10 to 2.5 (giving a 10% boost).

MORE HEALTH
To compensate for the lack of shield - we’ve increased player health from 100 to 110 hp. 

MORE RED SUGAR
Furthermore the amount of healing you get from red sugar has been increased 25% and the amount of red sugar spawned in a mission has been increased by 10%. 


TWEAKS 
-----------------------------------------------------

SOLO ENEMY NUMBERS & HEALTH
Exploring the caves of Hoxxes by yourself takes more time and can be brutal, so we have made it so the swarms will be a little bit smaller when you are on your own. Enemy health has also been lowered a little bit for solo expeditions. The creatures of Hoxxes are still dangerous so don’t drop your guard!  

BOSCO NOW WITH 50% MORE REVIVES
While he really wants to, Bosco can’t always save you from a cave leech. He feels really bad about it and has requested that he be allowed to revive you 3 times instead of 2. The request has been granted.

MACTERA SPAWN HEALTH INCREASED
In a continuing effort to perfect the Mactera Spawn we have changed its health from 180 to 210. Remember to use cover and aim for the weak-spot!
"
	Update_11 = "Hi Miners, 

We have another update for you with some cool new features, some tweaks and some bug fixes. Along with these smaller updates, we are now initiating some larger content and feature development. More on this later, when we reveal a larger roadmap of things to come. 

--- PATCH NOTES ---

COMMUNITY REQUESTED FIXES 
--------------------------------------------
GUNNER: GATLING GUN REWORK
There’s a been a lot of talk about the Gatling Gun being too weak especially on higher difficulties. We agree, and we have made a bunch of tweaks to it:
- Starting Ammo Capacity changed from 1800 to 1600 rounds.
- It is now fed ammo continuously from a single, upgradeable ammo drum - no more reloading!
- Overheats slightly faster - tweaked from 10 seconds of continuous fire to 9.
- Overheating is more punishing - time to cool down raised from 8 seconds to 10
- Upgrades reworked: Upgrades involving ammo and clip increase have now been made to only focus on the clip size. First upgrade originally gave you +400 bullets to max ammo it has been changed to +400 to clipsize. Second clip upgrade will give you a total boost of +400 bullets where it before only increased the clipsize. Resulting in the Gatling Gun packing impressive 2400 bullets when maxed out!  
- New Tungsten Bullet upgrade for Gatling Gun has been added allowing you to boost the damage 25%. A mandatory upgrade for players with affinity for Extreme difficulty.
- Added smoke effect to make it more obvious when you overheats

A BETTER BOSCO
If you pointed at a really tiny chunk of unmined minerals Bosco would go there and not find the tiny chunk then abort the task. Now he can find the chunk and dig it. Bosco is also much better at not sneaking up in front of you when you are mining. All quality of life fixes to you favorite drone!


NEW STUFF
--------------------------------------------
TEAM CAMS LET YOU STAY IN THE ACTION
1st iteration of Team Cams - Keep an eye on your teammates are doing while you are incapacitated. Now it is less of a downer being down! 

ELECTRO CRYSTALS
Deadly Electro Crystals have been added to Crystal Caverns. Don’t get too close - they pack a punch!

PLATFORMS PROHIBITED IN DROP POD  
Platforms (and Supply Pods) can not spawn/ attach to drop pod anymore. We get it... some off you had fun filling up the Drop Pod with platforms, but Management reminds you that Platform Concrete is notoriously hard to clean out!

GRAVITY RECALIBRATION
A temptingly tantalizing button called “Gravity Recalibration” has been activated on the Space Rig. Management will likely frown on employees abusing it - but it’s so big and red...

FIXED STEAM REGION SEARCH
Before some people had a hard time finding games in their own region. We have fixed this now (we hope)!

...And tons of minor stuff, mostly bug-fixes behind the scenes, but also small visual upgrades. For full overview see the patch notes below.
