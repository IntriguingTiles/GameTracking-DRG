On the 13th of May, Deep Rock Galactic is finally leaving Early Access! This has been an incredible journey and we could not have done it without you, our beloved community. You have supported us all the way with testing, translations, feedback, ideas, critique, memes, live streams, fan art, and fan trailers. You have made it possible for us to sell more than one million copies of the game and made sure that Deep Rock Galactic already is so much more than we ever imagined. 

But now, we need you more than ever! In these 14 days until we launch, we need to make the world aware about the launch of Deep Rock Galactic. We need to recruit new Dwarven Miners and train them properly. So how can you help? Here are some ideas:

Tell your friends that it is finally time to join the ranks
Write a comment on a post or share a post about Deep Rock Galactic
Share and like one of the many fantastic fan trailers as we showcase them
Share and like our announcements
Create your own post on Deep Rock in your gaming community
Stream the game on Twitch, Youtube, Mixer
Play the 1.0 pre-release build on Experimental Branch and give us feedback

It is finally time to say ROCK AND STONE to the world!
