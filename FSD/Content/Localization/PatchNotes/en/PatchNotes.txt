With Update 35 looming, if we can’t get modding support to the level of stability that we want within the next few days, we may have to postpone it until after Update 35 is live. Crossing our fingers that that won’t be an issue.</>

Hello Miners,

This is it! It’s finally happening. Modding support is here.

What started as a simple Save Game profile system turned into full-fledged modding support. We have spent the past months iterating on these features together with the modding community and it has been great to see it come to fruition. We are excited that you’re going to have the opportunity to try out all the weird/fun/awesome/puzzling mods on display from within the game. We have much we want to tell you about what is in this release, so keep reading.

With Love,
The Ghost Ship Crew


--- PATCH NOTES ---

MODDING MENU
----------------------------
You can access all User Generated Content from within the game through the brand-new Modding Menu within the ESC menu. mod.io allows you to upload and subscribe/install mods. The platform has everything you would expect. You can comment, rate and subscribe to your favorite mods.

This menu acts as your window to the wonderful world of DRG Mods. As you browse and try out mods, you will likely become familiar with our three Approval Categories that determine how the mods interact with your Save Game and host-client setup:

VERIFIED MODS
You can use Verified (for Base Game) Mods along with your Regular Save Game. These Mods will stay active even though you join a host who does not have those Mods installed. And other players will not have to download those Mods in order to join you. They essentially don’t have any restrictions on Save Games or client-host setup. 
This category is likely to be somewhat exclusive and limited to select mods. Examples would be QoL mods that do not impact gameplay, audio or visual mods that improve accessibility, and localized versions of in-game graphics.

APPROVED MODS
You can use Approved (for Progression) Mods along with your Regular Save Game, meaning you can still earn XP and Resources in your regular progression while using them. When you are joining a host who does not have the same Approved Mods installed as you, those Mods will be disabled. Likewise, when you are host then other players will have your active Approved Mods downloaded when trying to join your game.
Examples would be cosmetics, SFX, harder or alternative game modes, weapon changes, and mods that moderately alter gameplay elements but still retain progression inline with the regular game.

SANDBOX MODS
Sandbox will be the default category for any Mod uploaded to mod.io, before we have had a chance to assign an Approval Category to it. You are free to use any Sandbox Mods with a Modded Save Game. This means you cannot use your Regular Save Game with your main progression when playing with these mods. When you have Sandbox mods enabled you will also only be able to join other servers with Sandbox Mods. 
Examples of Mods that would fall into this category are Mods that change rewards or mission payout, and Mods that unlock in-game items.


SAVE GAME PROFILES FOR SANDBOX
----------------------------
Save game profiles were introduced in Update 34, but their use really comes from the Sandbox category of mods. With save game profiles, you can manage separate saves for your main progression and modded play that relies on Sandbox mods. Now you don’t need to be concerned about any impact to your main save when diving into the cool, crazy, inventive Sandbox mods.


SERVER LIST MOD FILTERS
----------------------------
There are now filters on the Server List where you can choose to show or hide servers that are running Approved or Sandbox Mods. So you have better control of your Server List.
As part of modding support we wanted to make it completely clear if you are joining a host who is using mods. So if you join a host that is running Approved Mods which you don’t have installed, the game will make sure to install those before you join that host. Likewise, if you have Approved Mods enabled which the host doesn't have, the game will disable those before you join.


NATIVE BLUEPRINT SPAWNING
----------------------------
This is a feature for modders mainly, that allows anyone modding the game better access to certain features and functionalities of DRG. If you are interested in building mods for DRG there is already a vibrant community with a discord server. 


[COMMUNITY REQUEST] TRANSLATION BRANCH
----------------------------
This has actually been live for a bit. If you are a community translator you can now access a Steam branch with a nightly build including newest translations from Crowdin. That means you no longer have to wait for a release to see your work in-game. Furthermore, your Save Game is synchronized between the translator branch and the main branch.

If you are interested in providing community translation for DRG, there is a community translator channel on our Discord with a very active community.

	Update_23 = "Alright, Miners - gather ‘round and shut up!

It appears ol’ Hoxxes still has plenty of surprises in store for us - over the last month or so, Scanners have picked up a slew of new and disturbing biosigns. We expect you all to face a significantly wider variety of wildlife down in the caves, so DOUBLE CHECK YOUR GEAR, and BRING ALL THE GRENADES YOU CAN CARRY. DRG isn’t in the business of being knife-eared cowards though, so get to it, and let’s get those quotas met!

With regards from Management,
- The Ghost Ship Crew

--- PATCH NOTES ---

A GAZILLION NEW ENEMIES
-----------------------------------
GLYPHID MENACE
- This distant cousin of the Glyphid Acidspitter is both smarter, faster, and more aggressive. It’ll burrow into the ground between firing off devastating volleys of corrosive goo, making for a high-priority target when spotted.

GLYPHID WARDEN
- This mysterious Glyphid sends out regenerative waves of spores to its nearby kin, reinvigorating and buffing them. Better take it out quick.

GLYPHID BULK DETONATOR
- A sickening horror of the deep. It’s Bulky and it Detonates. You’ll know it when you see it - and then you’ll likely die. You have been warned.

NAYAKA TRAWLER
- The first species encountered of this awful breed of Hoxxes wildlife. The Trawler has been observed in the Sandblasted Corridor Region and it burrows through sand at high speeds, aiming to catch prey in its’ extended maws as it passes. Don’t stand in front of it. 

GLYPHID GRUNT SLASHER
- A more durable and fast version of its weaker cousin, the Grunt. Plus...its long-bladed legs deal thrice the damage. Nasty buggers! 

GLYPHID GRUNT GUARD
- Another variation of the Glyphid Grunt. This one is heavily armored and has twice the health but is a bit slower than a normal Grunt.

RADIOACTIVE GLYPHID PRAETORIAN
- In the Radioactive Zone, Praetorians have mutated and now do radiation damage! Better keep your distance.

RADIOACTIVE GLYPHID EXPLODER
- Exploding with radiation! ‘Nough said! 

RADIOACTIVE GLYPHID SWARMERS
- They glow in the dark and are radioactive - they’re small enough that the radiation they emit isn’t enough to affect a healthy dwarf, however. 


ENEMY TWEAKS
-----------------------------------
GLYPHID DREADNOUGHT OVERHAUL
- New behavior: If the players are hidden in a small hole, the Dreadnought will now destroy the terrain until it gets to them. Can’t stop me now!
- New attack: Swarmer Egg. Besides the fireball, the Dreadnaught will shoot a projectile full of swarmers. If hits the players, it will also cover them with pheromones, turning them into the target of new enemy swarmer spawns.
- Regenerating armor. Make sure to attack it while it’s vulnerable. Health values have been modified to conform to this new system.
- An all-new Boss Health Bar lets you know when you are facing a serious challenge. For the moment it’s only for the new and improved Dreadnought, but it’s almost like we have plans to use it for more things in the future, isn’t it? :>
- Fixed the bug that would allow you to trap the Dreadnought using the Gunner’s shield
- All its attacks and behaviors have been tweaked. The Dreadnaught is now more aggressive, more responsive, and more dangerous. Management wishes you luck.
- More Nitra is spawning in elimination missions since you will need more ammo to take down a Dreadnought.
- Fix so 2 Dreadnoughts can’t spawn in Point Extraction at the same time
- Supply Pods won’t instakill a Dreadnought anymore - it still deals a good chunk of damage though.
- Dreadnought's fireball damage reduced
- Tweaks to Dreadnought's behavior for solo play

Q’RONAR SHELLBACK
- Rolling periods are now shorter so it will open up more often to shoot (which almost means more chances for players to shoot it).
- Armor resistance and base health reduced.
- It can only be found in Salt Pits now. Radioactive Exclusive Zone didn’t feel like a healthy place to settle down.

CAVE LEECH 
- Received a much-needed model and animation overhaul. Now grabbier than ever!

NAEDOCYTE SHOCKERS
- All new model and animations. 

BET-C BATTLE MULE
- BET-C’s grenades have proper models and improved shaders
- BET-C now moves away if there are players too close to her for a few seconds
- BET-C no longer turns into an unkillable murder machine if the parasites die too quickly

MISCELLANEOUS ENEMY TWEAKS
- Enemies now only use melee attacks that are in range to actually do damage
- Grabber only screams if its target is valid
- Chance of getting a generic scripted wave increased compared to special scripted waves
- Tweaked all the Glyphids blood particles. They are now much more visible
- Glyphids have received several new attack animations
- Glyphid Warriors have been renamed to Glyphid Grunt, because that’s what everyone kept calling them. Also, it fits. :>


MISSION TWEAKS
----------------------------------- 
DIFFICULTY
- Difficulty slightly reduced on 2-3 player games on Hazard Level 3-5

ELIMINATION MISSION
- The location of the cocoons will no longer be displayed using an icon, now they appear on the terrain scanner
- Cocoons are more evenly distributed throughout the map
- New debris has been added in the vicinity of the Cocoons, in case you had trouble spotting the 15 ton, pulsating, gurgling, alien egg

SALVAGE MISSION
- Defense Zones have been increased a bit in size

EGG COLLECTION
- Reduced Egg Collection goals depending on Cave Complexity from 5, 8, 10 to 4, 6, 8 

POINT EXTRACTION
- Slightly increased spawn rates
- Wave music added to the announced waves


CLEARER GEM FRAGMENT INDICATION
-----------------------------------
- The glowing bits around embedded crystals like, Aquarq, Jadiz etc. now only glow when said item is close. No more returning to already mined spots!


MORE GEAR MODS
-----------------------------------
- We are still in the process of adding mods to all the gear and we are slowly getting there. After this update, only the Pick Axe and the Grenades are left to do. 

LMG GUN PLATFORM
- Number of turrets, target prioritization, build speed, scan angle. You are a special snowflake and now your automated killing machine can be too.

SATCHEL CHARGE
- Have you ever thrown down a Satchel Charge only to regret it immediately? Well, now you can install a kill switch for safe disarming and retrieval. Plus many other mods like carve size and fear effects.

FLARE GUN
- More flares? Longer burn time? Auto-reload? Illuminate the situation with these and other mods.

SHIELD GENERATOR
- Customize the size, duration and recharge time of your happy place.

Please note: You have been refunded credits and minerals invested in previous upgrades!

STATUS EFFECTS ON HEALTH BAR
-----------------------------------
Enemies’ health bars now display status effects such as being electrocuted, etc. They also show temperature variations so players can now know how far from bursting into flames or freezing they are.


VANITY
-----------------------------------
MK5 ARMOR SETS
- Management has approved the introduction of an all-new set of armor for the most experienced employees to procure - the mighty Mark 5! 

1ST PERSON ARMOR
- All first-person animations now display the correct armor!

SUPPORTER GEAR MORE GOLDIER
- By popular request, the Supporter Upgrade Armor and Weapons have gotten a material overhaul - now more goldier than ever!


BOSCO QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS
-----------------------------------
- It will now try to position himself below cave leeches, and not above them
- It will be less glued to the floor when fighting except versus cave leeches
- It will not fire if something other than enemies is blocking his line of sight
- Doubled the frequency of Bosco checking if he should get out of the way


NEW MISC MODELS, SHADERS, AND ANIMATIONS
-----------------------------------
- New Mallet model for all your building and repair needs
- New Beacons for Supply Pods

Exciting times ahead!  
 
--- PATCH NOTES ---

RETIREMENT AND XP FIXES
----------------------------
We have been really positively surprised to see how well the retirement system has been received. However, we never intended people to go through a full retirement cycle as fast as we can see some of you are doing right now (as low as 4 hours). Our intent is that leveling a character to retirement level should take much, much longer. We have right now made a bunch of fixes to the existing system, but with update 19 you should be expecting a much bigger change to the system of Retirement and XP's. Consider yourself warned :-) 

- Prevent Giving Retirement Rank if you have 0 XP
- Prevent multiple clicks on retire character in the UI
- Retirement assignments mission rewards removed
- Triple XP is now Double XP

- Graphics Settings: Disabling fullscreen restore to prevent mouse issue and not being able to click continue into the game
- Fix case of clients cant load on join
- Fix scout IFG slowdown, was incorrectly set to only 30% slowdown, reset to 75%
- Lootbug drop nerfed. Used to drop 15-25 value gold and Nitra - now drops 5-15.
- Fixed Eliminations mission not always spawning enough cocoons. Dreadnought cocoon now carves a space for itself and has less strict spawn requirements
- Fix for cursor disappearing on campaign reward window.

X-MAS has come to Hoxxes and we are bringing you a gift just in time for the Holidays!  Furthermore, we’re happy to announce that it’s not a soft one! Actually, it’s loaded with HARD mods for Bosco, a Medibay, Revamped Weapon Models and a gazillion other cool features! 

All the best wishes,
The Ghost Ship Team!

--- PATCH NOTES ---

BOSCO MODS
----------------------------
Do you need Bosco to be a Medi Drone or a Killing Machine? Now it is all up to you!

Similarly to weapons, Bosco has access to mods that can be bought and equipped. These mods will let you customize the drone using some of the existing parameters, like for example number of revives or weapon damage, but we are also introducing a special secondary fire. Once the mod is active, the player can point with the Terrain Scanner and press [RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON] or (LEFT TRIGGER) and Bosco will fire a rocket at the target. 


MEDIBAY 1.0
----------------------------
When you and your teammates fail a mission, you will afterward wake up in the Medibay. Fight Together, Fail Together!


REVAMPED WEAPON MODELS
----------------------------
All the old weapon have been getting a graphical overhaul and should be on par with the new ones. For those who think looks are more important than substance!


X-MAS IN SPACE
----------------------------
We couldn’t help our self and had to dress up the Space rig for the holidays. You can also buy a limited headgear and play Santa with your friends. Please don’t destroy the decoration!   


MINERAL TRADE TERMINAL ASSIGNMENT
----------------------------
On order from Management new recruits no longer have direct access to the Mineral Trade Terminal. Access is now granted by proving yourself worthy by completing an assignment! Besides getting access to the Trade Terminal, players will be rewarded with 50 Croppa and 40 Jadiz upon completion.


SAVEGAME RESTORE OPTION
----------------------------
You can now restore your savegame from the Options Menu. This is just extra safety measures in the unlikely event that you should lose your save data. Management refuses this has ever happened though!   


WEAPON BALANCING: "WARTHOG" AUTO 210
----------------------------
- Base damage increased. 
- Supercharged Feed Mechanism mod rate of fire reduced, Bigger Pellets mod damage increased

	Update_20.1 = "Happy New Year, Miners! 
We have had a blast working on Deep Rock Galactic in 2018 and we are far from done yet! Thank you all for being part of what we think is the best community in the Galaxy - You are awesome, and we hope you will continue to follow us and the game’s development in 2019.

All the best wishes,
The Ghost Ship Team 


--- PATCH NOTES ---

UPDATE 20.1
----------------------------
The holidays have come and gone and all the seasonal stuff has been put away! We have fixed some crash bugs and you can now rebind controls to  ‘P’. Otherwise, it is very much the same as update 20.
 

BOSCO MODS
----------------------------
Do you need Bosco to be a Medi Drone or a Killing Machine? Now it is all up to you!

Similarly to weapons, Bosco has access to mods that can be bought and equipped. These mods will let you customize the drone using some of the existing parameters, like for example number of revives or weapon damage, but we are also introducing a special secondary fire. Once the mod is active, the player can point with the Terrain Scanner and press [RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON] or (LEFT TRIGGER) and Bosco will fire a rocket at the target. 


MEDIBAY 1.0
----------------------------
When you and your teammates fail a mission, you will afterward wake up in the Medibay. Fight Together, Fail Together!


REVAMPED WEAPON MODELS

All the old weapon have been getting a graphical overhaul and should be on par with the new ones. For those who think looks are more important than substance!


MINERAL TRADE TERMINAL ASSIGNMENT
----------------------------
On order from Management new recruits no longer have direct access to the Mineral Trade Terminal. Access is now granted by proving yourself worthy by completing an assignment! Besides getting access to the Trade Terminal, players will be rewarded with 50 Croppa and 40 Jadiz upon completion.


SAVEGAME RESTORE OPTION
----------------------------
You can now restore your savegame from the Options Menu. This is just extra safety measures in the unlikely event that you should lose your save data. Management refuses this has ever happened though!

	Update_9 = "Hello Miners!
Deep Rock Galactic has now been in the wild for 1 week. We have finished celebrating the awesome launch (yeah!) and are now hard at work getting new updates out. Inside the game, we have a nice feedback button, and a big thanks to the thousands of you who have already taken advantage of this. It’s an extremely big help. Below, you can read about the update.

--- Driller Buffs ---
The Driller is probably the most unique class in Deep Rock Galactic, so we were sad to see our iconic drilldozer valued below the other three classes in usefulness. Therefore, we have tweaked both his Flamethrower and Drills. In the detailed patch notes below, you can see the exact stat changes, which might also give you some hints on how to better utilize the Driller.

--- Payout on Mission Failed & Kicking ---
Two issues pretty quickly started to show themselves: Dissatisfaction with the way we’ve handled a Mission Failed scenario in regards to payout, and the fact that players could be kicked from the team at any given time. We’ve worked out a first pass on a solution for both these, as listed below:

Firstly, it used to be that failing a mission meant NO payout at all. Now, failing a mission will give you a compensation of 25% of the minerals stored in Molly at the time of the mission ending. 

Secondly, getting Kicked from a team will result in a Mission Failed case, where you will receive compensation based on what was added to Molly since you joined that session. 

It is now no longer possible to Join or being Kicked from a team once the Drop Pod has been called and the final countdown has begun. This is a test for now and we’ll monitor the outcome - and it’s a pretty easy fix, so we can quickly backpedal if needed.

Also, it is extremely important to understand how Mission Complete works. You might think that the rewards are split out between survivors. They are not. We calculate the total and then each player in the session gets that same reward, regardless of the size of the team. On top of this, each surviving player adds a Survivor Bonus, which has been boosted also. “Leave No Dwarf Behind” should be the ethos here - the more players manage to get out alive, the greater the bonus for all involved!


We have elected not to implement vote-kicking with this update, despite some players asking for it. It’s a fair bit of work to implement, and we are not completely convinced it is the way to go at this point. That said, there are good arguments both for and against this feature, and we will continue to monitor the situation. The same goes for a vote button on Molly. 

--- Bosco ---
Detailed in the patch notes below, Bosco has received a fairly significant buff, and his ability to kill Cave Leeches should have been improved. We write “should” since this issue will need further work to squash fully, but it should at least be a better experience all round now.

--- Trading Cards ---
This one is a bit embarrassing. Turns out you have to manually have to publish the Trading Cards when you launch a new game on Steam. Whoops. The good news is that they are implemented now and await harvesting!


--- Roadmap ---
Midweek, we had a big feedback meeting here at the Ghost Ship office. We’ve gathered all the feedback from you, the players, as well as feedback from the dev team and our partners. There are SO MANY cool things we can and will do to expand Deep Rock Galactic. Task for now is to choose which ones go in the game, and in which order, and we plan to reveal a greater and more comprehensive road map for the coming months over the next few weeks.

"
	Update_30 = "Hello Miners!
It’s fantastic to finally be welcoming you all to Deep Rock Galactic 1.0!  

This marks the end of more than two years of Early Access development and It has been an amazing journey! We could not have asked for a better community to have along for the ride. And, if you are a new player, rest assured that hard work in the mines awaits you, alongside high adventure, big guns, fancy beards, alien monsters ... and of course - all your fellow dwarven miners! 

We are super, super excited to leave Early Access and seeing where the game will go from here. And fear not...we are far from done adding to DRG!

Rock And Stone!

With Love,
The Ghost Ship Crew

--- PATCH NOTES ---

SOUNDTRACK VOL. II
----------------------------
For the last year we have been working on a Vol. II of the soundtrack for DRG - and it is finally here - allowing you to mine, fight and groove to 14 completely new tracks of synthy, bassy goodness! Deep Rock Galactic needs to invest in some bigger speakers… NOW!


NEW PROMOTION TIERS
----------------------------
Believe it or not but now there are 3 more Tiers above Gold, for when you are promoting your dwarves: PLATINUM, DIAMOND, LEGENDARY! This is mainly a show-off thing for super veteran players who have been investing blood, sweat and a lot of time in Deep Rock Galactic. We salute you! 


PRESTIGE ASSIGNMENTS
----------------------------
As you increase your Player Rank, you will get access to special Prestige Assignments. Completing them will reward you with full sets of Pickaxe parts, Armor skins and new Helmets. Prestige Assignments are unlocked at Player Rank 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75 and 100. 

A couple of months ago we were toying around with awarding you vanity on the promotion itself (some of you might have tested it on the Experimental build), but we were not totally happy with the system and have instead gone for an approach with unlocking Prestige Assignments based on your Player Rank.    


BIOMES
----------------------------
Crystalline Caverns have gotten more crystal variations. It’s now crystal clear why it is called by that name!

	Update_31 = "Hello Miners!
It’s time for our first Post-Launch Update! And speaking of the launch - a hearty welcome to all the new miners! We hope you enjoy the game, and we want to give a big thank you to all the veteran miners who have been helping you learn the ins and outs of deep space mining since launch. 

Update 31 is primarily focused on doing a bit of pick-up after launch - adding some things we had to cut for Launch because of time constraints, as well as fixing a ton of minor and major bugs and crashes based on feedback from you guys. Update 32 will add new Mission Types, but more on that when our plans are more fleshed out.

Cheers,
The Ghost Ship Crew

--- PATCH NOTES ---

MINER’S MANUAL: CREATURE PAGES

An obvious part of the Miner’s Manual we planned from the very beginning is full a library of every creature in the game.

	Update_26 = "Hello Miners!
Update 26 is here! In this second part of the Endgame, we’ve added a brand new system of Machine Events to encounter during normal missions, a much needed overhaul and expansion of the Bar, all new Victory Moves, as well as skins for both Bosco and your weapons, plus an absolute ton of minor bug fixes, tweaks, and improvements. Let’s get to work!


--- PATCH NOTES ---

MACHINE EVENTS
----------------------------
- Deep Rock Galactic is developing strategic operations all around the planet. The company is worried about some strange mutations affecting the creatures of Hoxxes as well as peculiar crystals interfering with scanners and other devices in orbit. To eradicate the threat or simply to take samples, these operations require expert dwarven action to be finalized. If you stumble upon one, give it a go and hope that the reward is worth the risk!

Three different Machine Events can be found in random missions: Kursite Infection, Rock Mutation, and Tritilyte Crystal. Each of them offers a different timed challenge that must be completed in order to get access to the Core Infuser where Blank Matrix cores can be used.

- To activate a Machine Event, the player must own the Tritilyte Key. You will own a Tritilyte key if you have a Promoted dwarf.


BLANK MATRIX CORES
----------------------------
- Blank Matrix Cores are part of the rewards for Deep Dives and the Core Hunt assignment. The first section of both Deep Dives will now reward Blank Matrix Cores instead of Mineral Cores. They can be infused by doing Machine Events, turning them into Overclock or Cosmetic Matrix Cores that can be used in the Forge.

NEW WEAPON SKIN
----------------------------
- One new set of weapon skins, Neon Band, has been added to cargo crate rewards


WEAPON, MODS, OVERCLOCKS BALANCE
----------------------------
M1000

	Update_27 = "Hello Miners!
Update 27 is here, and just in time for the holidays! This update is a big bag of both lesser and major goodies: We’ve wrapped up the last Machine Event and added a ton of small but significant improvements and features - and a new enemy also managed to make the cut! 
 
And from all of us here at the office: All the best wishes and a happy New Year! Now get back to work!

- The Ghost Ship Team 


--- PATCH NOTES ---

NEW MACHINE EVENT: OMEN MODULAR EXTERMINATOR
----------------------------
R&D came up with a brilliant idea for helping out our Pest Control teams: Project Omen - a vast network of interlinked Modular Extermination Towers, strategically inserted into caves all over Hoxxes. However, much to their regret, the Exterminators turned out to be just as dangerous to our own people as the bugs they were supposed to protect us against! So, the strategy is clear: Project Omen needs to be shut down. However… for security reasons, that can only be done through a… hands-on approach, by our esteemed ground teams. 

Get in there, find and activate the Exterminator, engage the Maintenance Pads to expose the machine Cooling Tanks, and blow them to bits. Easy. Well, and you have to do so within a limited time window or the device goes into Lockdown.

PS: Do note, the Exterminators can be constructed from a variety of different modules, so for your personal safety, do take care to learn the patterns of each. R&D aren’t in the business of making kids’ toys, after all...


NEW ENEMY: GLYPHID OPPRESSOR
----------------------------
The Glyphid Oppressor is basically Veteran Glyphid Praetorian. It is a slow and extremely heavily armored tank - impossible to deal with from the front, but has a weak spot in the back. Up close, it deals a lot of damage and has a powerful area knockback attack. It can dig through the ground to get to you - Maneuverability is key to take it down this unstoppable beast.  


LOADOUTS (COMMUNITY REQUEST)
----------------------------
Tweaking and modding your equipment has been a big thing in the game for a long time, and only got more complex with the introduction of Weapon Overclocks. So by popular demand, as well as our own, you can now set up and save up to three full loadouts for each of your dwarves!


NEW WEAPON SKIN
----------------------------
The FOURTH RELIC weapon skin can be found for all weapons in the Cargo Crates in the mines. It’s a callback to the past glory and greatness of the dwarf nation - adorn your boomsticks with golden ritual bands and clan insignia, and make your stand!


SMALL NEW ANIMATIONS
----------------------------
After introducing the recent pickup animations, we got inspired and have added a handful of other ones as well to better describe the actions happening. New animations added for: 
- Ledge Grab
- Interacting with a Terminal 
- Hanging pose when on a zipline 
- Throwing of carriable objects
- ...and maybe some more?


GAMEPLAY AND BALANCE TWEAKS 
----------------------------
- The Warning Shield Disruption will now give a smaller Health bonus.
- Enemies now back out of active Shields instead of turning around and running away exposing their weak butts.
- Glyphid Guards and Praetorians have had their Resistances to Temperature and Stun increased, making them a bit tougher to kill.
- Glyphid Guard has had its health increased.
- Glyphid Bulk Detonators unfreeze faster and when if they die while frozen they now explode with a nonlethal shockwave.
- Jadiz and Enor pearl can now be found in Cargo Crates and are being dropped by the Hooli Hoarder.
- Stepping over loose chunks of Minerals makes them float to you instead of just popping away.


WEAPON MODS & OVERCLOCKS BALANCE
----------------------------
THUNDERHEAD AUTOCANNON
- Fixed the fire rate ramp-up mechanic so that the Lighter Barrel Assembly mod now works correctly and the weapon's top rate of fire can be displayed in the weapon stats as rounds per second instead of a percentage.
- Replaced the Quickfire Ejector mod with a Magazine Capacity mod.
- The Damage Resistance at Full RoF mod now displays a shield icon when it is active and the resistance amount can be seen in the weapon stats.


BEARDS & ARMORS 
----------------------------
R&D has been very busy cooking up a solutions to ensure heavy beards and heavy armor can coexist in peace and harmony. Facial hair and combat suits are not natural friends, but now selecting a large beard will custom fit your heavy armor to make sure there is room for all that bushy glory.

This solution is not fully implemented yet! But our team of armorers and barbers are working round the clock to get all combinations of beard and armor looking their best.


NEW CAVE CONTENT 
----------------------------
We have once again turned our attention to the caves and will be improving the variety of the special formations and flora that you can find down in the depths. For this update, we have added just a few new things to Fungus Bogs and The Salt Pits but there is more on the way.

In the coming updates more will be added all over the place.


ABYSS BAR
----------------------------
- All beers now have unique beer mugs! Beer just tastes better when it’s looking fancy!
- (COMMUNITY REQUEST) Unlocking a new beer now triggers Lloyd to serve up a free round - Only fair since you spend all the time collecting the beer ingredients.
Visiting the Abyss bar has never been more exciting! 


UI & HUD
----------------------------
We are doing a lot of minor visual improvements all over the UI and HUD and will continue to do so in the coming time. For now, we’ve been focusing on making Unlocks and Rewards feel more satisfying and informative.
- The mission map has received parallax scrolling to make it feel more dynamic
- Ammo Status UI has been updated and better shows your ammo status


MISC. & FIXES

"
	Update_21 = "Hello Miners!
With this update, we are introducing more insane challenges - a new LETHAL difficulty level for you to master, multiple new enemies, Mastery and Skins for weapons, and a gazillion other fixes and improvements.

Lunch Break is over! It’s time to go to work!

- The Ghost Ship Team 

--- PATCH NOTES ---


NEW ENEMIES
-----------------------------------
BET-C - THE BATTLE M.U.L.E.
Deep Rock Galactic didn’t invest much in the safety system of their BET-C series of combat M.U.L.E.’s. It only takes a few Xynarch Charge-Sucker parasites licking the robot’s circuits to turn them against the dwarves. In that situation, BET-C’s fast-tracking auto-turret and grenade launcher could become a major threat for any expedition. If you find an infected model, aim for the attached organisms and, once they are eradicated, carefully hammer BET-C until it turns into a trustworthy companion for the rest of the mission.

Q’RONAR SHELLBACK 
The Q’ronar Shellback is a deadly creature that you might bump into in the Radioactive and Salty regions of Hoxxes. Their tough shells and fast movement speed make them quite hard to kill - try to dodge its rolling attack and kill the Shellback when it stops to spray poison venom at you. 

NAEDOCYTE SHOCKER
The Naedocyte Shocker is a strange alien flying jellyfish-like creature. They often appear in large swarms and is preferably dealt with before they get close enough to zap you with electrical shocks. So far they’ve been spotted in the regions of Dense Biozone and the Glacial Strata.  


NEW DIFFICULTY LEVEL
-----------------------------------
By popular demand, we’ve added a LETHAL new difficulty setting only for the most masochistic and badass dwarves out there! We hope you have “fun”... :D


OVERALL DIFFICULTY REVAMP
-----------------------------------
GENERAL SPAWN LOGIC: The general logic behind how we handle spawns has gotten a big overhaul - balancing waves is now a much more exact and controllable thing for us. This is actually the biggest of all changes we’ve done to the difficulty system, but also the hardest to explain in detail - maybe we’ll do a blog post on this in the future :-)

MISSION SPECIFIC ENEMY TYPES: The Mission Generator now also pre-selects the specific mix of enemies players will encounter in a given mission. Instead of randomly selecting from every enemy type available in the game, players will now face themed swarms of enemies. This change won’t be particularly visible right now, but will serve to improve the overall feel and flow of the enemy swarms as we add more enemy types to the game.

The goal here is to make each mission feel a lot more unique, as well as making it more attractive for players to pursue a more strategic approach - if you have a rough idea of what awful things you might face down in the depths, you stand a better chance of going in as prepared as you can be.

TIME: As a rule, lowering the time between spawning enemy waves means more enemies in general, which results in an overall higher difficulty. Knowing this, we’ve made a few changes to how we time waves:
- Time elapsed before the first wave appears is based on Difficulty - so higher Difficulty means the first wave arrives faster.
- Subsequent waves will also spawn faster depending on difficulty level.

SPEED: Attack speed, projectile speed, and movement speed of enemies are increased for the highest difficulties.

ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS: You now take more damage from environmental dangers on higher difficulties.

YOU GET THE WAVES YOU DESERVE: Multiple waves are now allowed to spawn at the same time and do not cancel each other out.
- Example 1: Digging two eggs out in Egg hunt will generate two small waves instead of only one. 
- Example 2: You can not cancel a wave in progress by calling in the drop pod

IMPORTANT BUGFIX! It turned out Difficulty scaling from 3 to 4 players was not working before - meaning that a 4 player game was as easy as a 3 player game. That is fixed now - so you should feel an overall increase in difficulty for 4 player games on all difficulties. We’ll, of course continue to monitor and tweak as needed.


UI IMPROVEMENTS
-----------------------------------
NEW ENEMY HEALTH BAR
We’ve completely revamped the way we put health bars on enemies. Now it will show when the player is aiming at an enemy and it will do it on top of that enemy (instead of in the center of the screen). Additionally, it displays the damage applied to the enemy with every shot.

NEW MISSION READOUT BAR
The Mission Readout Bar visible on the Space Rig has been updated with more information about the mission in progress, as well as gotten a graphical overhaul.


NEW BIOME CONTENT
-----------------------------------
In The Salt Pits Region, you’ll now start seeing fragile Salt Platforms - stand on them, but be careful. They’re not tested for dwarf girth. 


PREVENT LATE JOIN DUPLICATION
-----------------------------------
You want a diverse team? You don't like teams with three Engineers? The Host now has the option to select “PREVENT LATE JOIN DUPLICATION” from the Escape menu and Options menu. Selecting this option means players LATE JOINING your game will need to select a character class not currently in play. 

Please note: This option does NOT restrict character selection on the Space Rig - we leave that up to you guys to figure out among yourselves. 


MORE EQUIPMENT MODIFICATIONS
-----------------------------------
The new Modification System has now been implemented for the traversal tools. That means more customization for the Power Drills, the Platform Gun, the Zipline Gun, and the Grappling Gun. Furthermore, your armor modding opportunities also got some tender, loving care...


WEAPON MASTERY AND SKINS
-----------------------------------
A Weapon Mastery Bar has been added to all gear - as you unlock mods for a given piece of gear, your Mastery with it increases. At certain levels of Mastery, you’ll gain free bonuses. For now the bonuses are restricted to Skins, and only for the primary and secondary weapon slots. Each weapon has three unlockable skins to get.

The majority of our time with this has been spent on getting the system up and running, but we definitely intend to expand on the Skins System as we move a bit further ahead - you can expect other ways than just through the weapon masteries to earn skins in the future. 


WEAPON TWEAKS & FIXES
-----------------------------------

- Flying Nightmare damage no longer stacks on top of direct hit damage.

MISC.
-----------------------------------

	Update_19 = "Hello Miners! 

We got a fat, new update coming your way - this time with a massive upgrade to your armory, improvements to the upgrade system and an overhaul of the retirement system! Read all about it below! Lock n’ Load!

--- PATCH NOTES ---

8 NEW WEAPONS
----------------------------
DRG is happy to inform you that we’ve expanded on our list of suppliers, and a new, larger catalog of armaments has been made available! In order to obtain licenses for the new gear, you will need to complete Weapon Assignments. When a license has been obtained, you will be allowed to purchase access to the weapon in question. The following new weapons are now available:   

NEW WEAPONS: GUNNER
----------------------------
"THUNDERHEAD" HEAVY AUTOCANNON: A peculiar but devastating weapon. The slow rate of fire is made up for by heavy damage, delivered with glee by the belt-fed .50-caliber tungsten rounds. The Thunderhead is a somber weapon for the sophisticated executioner, delivering death as inexorably as the passage of time itself.

BRT7 BURST FIRE GUN: More precise than an SMG, with the stopping power of a small shotgun, the BRT (or "Burt", as it's sometimes called) is highly prized among collectors and connoisseurs alike.


NEW WEAPONS: SCOUT
----------------------------
M1000 CLASSIC: The original design for the M1000-pattern DRG-issue precision rifle goes back hundreds of years, practically unchanged. High damage, respectable fire rate...and that "Ping". A prime example of "if it ain't broke, don't fix it".

ZHUKOV NUK17: Never sophisticated, but never disappointing either. The NUK family of twinned micro SMGs has a long and treasured track record, yet Those In The Know generally agree that the 17 is among the very best. 


NEW WEAPONS: ENGINEER
----------------------------
"STUBBY" VOLTAIC SMG: So what's better than an SMG? An SMG that fires ELECTRIC BULLETS! The boys in R&D have wired a prototype ArcGen into the guts of this trusty Subata 312, meaning it now unleashes a storm of electrified DEATH! Word of warning: Keep away from water.

BREACH CUTTER: The Breach Cutter releases directional blasts of sonically-charged plasma powerful enough to deal with most any alien in your path. Originally a mining tool, it's now been frequency-tuned to crack open flesh and bone rather than the sediment deposits it was designed for - often with quite spectacular results!


NEW WEAPONS: DRILLER
----------------------------

CRYO CANNON: Mad geniuses have tried perfecting this implement for as long as anyone can remember, but our lads at R&D seem to have perfected it! Handily portable (for a dwarf, anyway), it does exactly what you think: It's a friggin' freeze ray. Let 'em have it.

EXPERIMENTAL PLASMA CHARGER: Bullets are so last year. Instead, why not incinerate your enemies from the inside out with a highly experimental anti-matter-powered gun firing supercharged plasma bolts? What's the worst that could happen? (If you find out, please report to R&D).


NEW WEAPON MODS SYSTEM
----------------------------
The Weapon Upgrade System has been scrapped in favor of a brand new Weapon Modification System, and each weapon can now be customized and tweaked to your individual tastes! More than 200 new Weapon Mods have been introduced, a lot of them consisting of entirely new features. For example, “Blow-through” is now a thing - fire bullets straight through an enemy to hit enemies behind it! Or how about “Fear” - send enemies into a fleeing panic by sheer brunt of your firepower! 

For this round of upgrades, the new system has been implemented for all new and old weapons, but it is not yet implemented on tools, grenades, and armors. This will happen with future updates. 

Also, no more static still-pictures of gear on the upgrade screen - we’ve finally gotten a proper and rotatable 3D model viewer implemented!


REPRICING OF VANITY AND WEAPON MODS
----------------------------
All vanity items and weapon upgrades have been repriced! You’ll keep any vanity items already unlocked. All weapon upgrades have been refunded, leaving you open to explore the new system at leisure. 


PROMOTION (FKA RETIREMENT)
----------------------------
The Retirement system has received a fairly significant overhaul. The changes are as follows:

- “Retirement” has been rephrased to “Promotion” instead.
- The level cap for each dwarf has been raised from 20 to 25
- The last mission in a Promotion Qualification Assignment is no longer a forced solo mission
- Promoting your dwarf no longer takes any progress away from you! Yes, you read correctly - all weapon upgrades carry over! The only thing that resets is your character’s level
- You still have to clear your debt to DRG before getting a promotion
- Titles for player ranks have been extended to player rank 75 and a lot of new titles have been added


GUNNER: SHIELD GENERATOR 
----------------------------
The Gunner has swapped his DET PACK (C4) for a SHIELD GENERATOR. It creates a force field that keeps the bugs at bay and protects everyone inside it.  We got a quick comment from the gunner: “To be honest, sharing gear with Drill-boy ain’t for me, so I called in a favor with the eggheads up in R&D to make me something special - and they came back with a friggin’ Shield Generator! Now I can safely stand my ground while killing bugs galore! Good times!”  


EGGHUNT TWEAK
----------------------------
Digging an egg free in Egghunts now has a chance of spawning a group of angry bugs. The number of eggs you need to collect have been increased a bit.    


BEER BUFFS 
----------------------------
TODAY’S SPECIAL: A Randomly chosen buffed beer will be available for purchase each “day” (it updates when the mission map gets new missions). Also, the buffs are actually working now! :-)


TERRAIN SCANNER ALIGNMENT
----------------------------
With the Terrain Scanner active, hit [SPACE] / (X) to spin your character around to face in the direction of the map.


SPECIAL WAVES
----------------------------
Once in a while you can now run into pure waves of Praetorians, Macteras, Glyphid Warriors or Swarmers. Whether these waves are harder or easier than normal waves is for you to figure out. 


ENEMY TWEAKS
----------------------------
- NEW ENEMY - THE GLYPHID VETERAN WARRIOR: The Veteran has 50% more health and much stronger armor than a normal Glyphid Warrior.
- Glyphid Praetorians have been to the gym! Their health has been buffed by 50% and they’re less susceptible to being shot in the head than before - getting behind them and shooting them in their big fat butts is now much more important.
- Sound has been added to Exploder footsteps. Listen carefully and you can hear them sneak up upon you!
- Removed fire particle effect when other enemies are hit by the Praetorians Acid Spray.
It was not supposed to be there and was causing a significant frame drop.
- Tweaked the number of enemies spawning for 2-player games down a bit for Hazard 2 and 3.

- When someone late-joins your game, there is a grace period where their friendly fire is reduced so they deal significantly less damage to you and your teammates.

	Update_15 = "Hello Miners! 
Before we head out for a couple of weeks of sorely needed summer vacation, we have cooked up a lovely little mutation to the game for you all!

--- PATCH NOTES ---

MUTATOR SYSTEM
----------------------------
From now on, all missions have a chance to appear with Mutators attached to them. They come in two variants: Warnings and Anomalies. Anomalies are neutral or even positive, while Warnings will severely increase the danger you’ll face. Missions with Warnings on them also add a substantial Hazard Bonus to the final score. Look on the mission map for the new Warning and Anomaly icons!

The following Warnings and Anomalies are already implemented, and we expect to add lots more in future patches.

WARNINGS:

- EXPLODER INFESTATION: Whatever mutation affects the Glyphid Exploders, this is likely one of the epicenters! Hordes of ‘roided-up, rabid Glyphid Exploders will do their best to turn you into a fine red mist.

- SHIELD DISRUPTION: The cave is heavily electrostatically charged. And wouldn’t you know it, it makes your shield generators short out. So...no shields!

- MACTERA PLAGUE: Macteras of all kinds have completely taken over this cave! Flying horror descends from the sky! You could say it’s going to be... Macterrible!
 
- CAVE LEECH CLUSTERS: If you have a phobia of Cave Leeches, this cave will either cure you or confirm your worst fears...

ANOMALIES:

- GOLD RUSH: This cave has extraordinarily rich deposits of gold; huge veins of it just waiting for the sweet caress of your pickaxe!
 
- MINERAL MANIA: Crafting Minerals galore! It is the reason to go to Hoxxes after all.

- TRIPLE XP: 10 credits says you can’t guess what it does...

- LOW GRAVITY: Jump vast chasms! Scale nearly vertical walls! Just keep in mind... fall damage is still a thing, so don’t get TOO cocky...

- CRITICAL WEAKNESS: Multikill! Aim for the weak spots for severely increased damage!

- GOLDEN BUGS: Each kill earns gold for the team!

- RICH ATMOSPHERE: You feel energized and can move faster around. Your beautiful voice may appear slightly altered by the rich atmosphere, Chipmunk!


TERRAIN SCANNER - NOW IN 3D!
----------------------------
The ol’ flat Terrain Scanner has had an overhaul! The camera is now fully rotatable and zoomable, and you’ll have a much easier time finding where you need to go. Terrain Scanner has been mapped to both [TAB] and [M] by default. Go try it out! 


VANITY UPDATES
----------------------------
DYE YOUR HAIR OR DIE DYEING!
For Update 14, we experimented briefly with locking hair colors to classes, to make them stand out more. It turns out the players didn’t enjoy that too much... in fact, we practically feared being strung up like elves! Rejoice, however! Custom hair colors are back, and are even a bit more advanced now!

MORE HEADWEAR ADDED
A couple of new hairdos have been added (The Franklin and The Gamekeeper), as well as a bunch of much-requested variations to some of the hats and helmets!

TAKE YOUR DWARF FOR A SPIN!
Ever wondered what your dwarf looks like from behind? Well, you can now rotate your dwarf in all the relevant menus!

Note: For those who wondered where all your armor went after Update 14, it was down to a massive reworking of the system we use for all the Vanity items. All those affected should have gotten all the credits and minerals you spent on them back.


BOSCO UPDATES
----------------------------
AN EVEN BETTER BOSCO
Bosco has had a brain upgrade and should now be much better at doing what he’s told and dishing out damage. He is so good that we had to tweak down his damage from 8 to 6 per bullet. His burst fire has also been adjusted to be a bit slower.

RETURN OF THE DRONE
When starting a multiplayer game solo, Bosco joins you until another player joins. If that player drops out again, Bosco will reappear!


SERVER IMPROVEMENTS
----------------------------
EASY FRIEND INVITE
Invite your friends directly into your game! And you don’t even have to have set up a mission yet!

JOIN FRIENDS UNINVITED 
You can always join your friend’s game - unless they already have a full team that is!

SEE FULL SERVERS
The Server List didn’t show full servers before - it does now!


MISC.
----------------------------
REGENERATING HEALTH
Health will regenerate to a specific minimum after taking massive damage. No more running around with 1 hit point!

MINIGUN UPDATE
The Minigun has had a massive overhaul, with a snazzy new model, improved animations, and new particles. After firing the Minigun, the accuracy is reduced at a slower rate.

LOOK WHO’S TALKING NOW
An icon is shown next to a player’s icon when using voice chat.

HUD IT LIKE YOU WANT
Some aspects of the HUD can now be hidden through the Options. For now, Enemy Health Bars, the Compass, your depth, Player Name, Class, and Class Icon.

SALVAGE OPERATION TWEAKS
- Uplink and Fuels Cells have gotten new models and animations.
- Escape Pod powering up time reduced from 120 seconds to 90 seconds.

PERKS, BUFFS, AND NERFS
- Increased the sprint speed bonus of the Weekend Athlete perk.
- Rank 3 Field Medic Perk will send nearby Glyphids fleeing when you finish reviving a teammate.
- Rank 5 Resupplier Perk will auto-reload all your weapons when you resupply.
- Fixed grammar and typos on several Perks and Milestones.
- Red Sugar Rocks: Max rank will give you a 20% speed boost for ten secs.

MAJOR NEW FEATURES

Get ready for a combat heavy experience where teamwork and good preparation is key to success! Don’t be another failure!

NEW ENEMY: THE MACTERA GRABBER
The Grabber is the new terror from the sky. It snatches up a random dwarf and flies away with him, before dropping him to crack like a nut on the floor below! Depending on your luck, you might just end up with some bruises - or you might end up being dumped into a chasm! Shoot ‘em quick, that’s our suggestion...

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Deep Rock Galactic are now tracking your work performance! On the KPI screen in your cabin you can check out detailed stats on your performance, you can reach milestones and earn perk points, and you can spend those points on unlocking awesome perks for your dwarves, making your day to day work a little easier.

- Build the beard of your dreams! Individually customize hair, eyebrows, sideburns, moustache and beard!

- The original selection of beards has been broken up into parts and added back in to support the new system. 
-  A small selection of new Hats, Hair, Helmets, Beards, Moustaches, and Sideburns have been added. We are by no means done here yet, this was just what we managed to get in for this patch.

NEW ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS
- During missions in the Sandblasted Corridors, you will now have a chance of  encountering blinding sandstorms and forceful wind tunnels. 
- The Magma Core just got a lot hotter! Try to avoid the hot magma rock - It burns! Also notice that explosions will expose the hot magma rock under the surface - turning the battlezone into a dangerous place for friends and foes.

"
	Update_28 = "Hello Miners,
Feeling Perky? Good, because UPDATE 28 is here to satisfy you with a meaty overhaul of our entire Perk System, the first part of the Space Rig redesign, as well as a very cool new addition to the way you can customize the look of your firearms. 

The current focus for us here at Ghost Ship is to get the game ready for 1.0. Some of the ongoing tasks are a better onboarding experience for new players, as well as the upcoming Miner’s Manual which will teach you more about the game. And last but not least we’ll be doing a ton of quality of life improvements - but all that is for future updates, for now, we’re talking Update 28. Let’s dive in!

Cheers,
The Ghost Ship Crew

--- PATCH NOTES ---

PERK SYSTEM OVERHAUL
----------------------------
Perks can now either be Passive or Active. Passive Perks are pretty much what the Perks used to be. Equip one of these and you get a passive increase to a given stat. No activation needed - equip it and the benefit is just there. Active Perks, however, requires activation from you, and generally have either a Cooldown on their use or limited uses - sometimes even both! Their limited usability is compensated for by letting us make them more powerful.

With Update 28 we are also introducing a bunch of new Perks, both Passive and Active, and have tweaked the costs and requirements for pretty much all of them. This means that all Perk purchases have been reset, any spent Perk Points have been refunded to you, and all Perks need to be unlocked once more.

We hope you’ll have a lot of fun playing around and experimenting with the new Perk System, and as always we’re looking forward to hearing your feedback. 


SPACE RIG REDESIGN
----------------------------
The Space Rig is something we’ve wanted to update for a long time. It is, however, a large task, and we will be doing it in steps. The first and most crucial step is what we’re doing in Update 28 - the overall rearranging and restructuring of the place, and getting everything in more contextually sound and meaningful positions instead of just having rows of identical terminals next to each other. Work on the Space Rig will continue from now on and up until we end Early Access and launch the game fully, and will include full terminal overhauls such as how we’ve treated the Forge by giving it a fully custom model from the get-go.


PAINTJOBS & FRAMEWORKS [COMMUNITY REQUEST]
----------------------------
Sometimes good things come out of a bug! As some players have pointed out, a bug in the Equipment Terminal allowed you to merge some of the weapon skins together. We’ve decided to implement it as a full feature after seeing the response it’s been getting. 

Weapon Skins are now divided into two distinct categories: Frameworks and Paintjobs. Frameworks change the actual model - adding or altering stuff on the weapon to make it look different. And Paintjobs is the overall coloring and texturing of the weapon. Making this split allows for a lot more combinations than were available so far, and should serve to make new Paintjobs feel a lot more rewarding to get than before since you can use it with any Framework. Every existing skin has gone through this revamp, and you get to keep anything you’ve already unlocked.


BLANK CORES VS. RESOURCE CANISTERS [COMMUNITY REQUEST]
----------------------------
If you have obtained all Overclocks you used to get a resource core in place of an Overclock. You now get a blank core instead. We agree with you that it makes so much more sense, though it will make you guys who play a lot, burn through the content that much faster. 


MISC.
----------------------------
- Lootbugs can now seek out and eat loose mineral chunks!!!
- Overhauled the damage direction indicator
- Added loadout selection to the Character Selection Terminal
- Added loadout selection to the Character Selection screen when joining a mission in progress

- Improved the collider of the Cargo Crates
- Cargo Crate outline is now visible on hold Tab from when you insert the first battery until the loot is collected for the local player

- Mactera Grabbers and Nayaka Trawlers can no longer grab Spitball Infectors and Brood Nexuses if they have been hit by a Pheromone Grenade

- Fixed a bug that made some Omen Modular Exterminator module combinations rarer than others

- Proximity Mine now has a 3-minute lifespan after being triggered once
- Disabled dwarves being outlined when shouting
- Changed text from pickup to disarm when retrieving a Satchel Charge 
- [Translation] Fixed Weakpoint Stun Chance / Duration could not be translated correctly

"
	Update_29 = "Hello Miners,
It’s time for another update as we’re ramping up for full release! The main focus for this update has been on improving the first experience new Greenbeards will encounter, but we also have a lot of goodies for veteran players, such as Armors finally being able to get new Paintjobs, and an all-new Miner’s Manual to name a few!

Cheers,
The Ghost Ship Crew

--- PATCH NOTES ---

PICKAXE CUSTOMIZATION
----------------------------
Every miner needs a pickaxe, but no two pickaxes need to look the same! Find and unlock new parts to customize each of the six different sections of your pickaxe, not to mention a handful of brand new Paintjobs for it as well. Crack those rocks in style!


LOST PACK ENCOUNTER
----------------------------
If you see some lost gear scattered around the place, try to find a blinking helmet. Use that to download the location of the lost dwarf’s backpack and track it down using your Terrain Scanner. They are always full of pickaxe parts and precious minerals. 


DROP POD OVERHAUL
----------------------------
Let’s be blunt… the Drop Pod has been in need of a facelift for a while. That has now happened - including Fuzzy Dice!


NEW DWARF SHOUTS
----------------------------
BISMOR, BISMOR, BISMOR! A good bunch of new shouts have been added, including some notorious missing Laser Pointer shouts!
 

SPACERIG EXTERIOR
----------------------------
Did you know that the Launch Bay is only a small part of the Spacerig infrastructure?


MINER’S MANUAL
----------------------------
Missions, Crafting Resources, Damage Types, Weapon Mods... There are so many systems in DRG! It can be overwhelming at first. We collected as much information as we could and created a ton of new infographics to make a guide. Hopefully this will help during the first few hours of the game. There might even be some details veteran miners didn’t know.

It’s the intention that the Miner’s Manual will continue to expand with new entries and chapters in future updates.


IMPROVED TUTORIAL
----------------------------
Mining is way more fun once you know the basics. There is now a brand-new and more streamlined Tutorial with clear instructions and tasks. Let’s get the Greenbeards up to speed as soon as possible, Management wants to see that ore flowing!


ESCAPE-MENU OVERHAUL 
----------------------------
With the inclusion of the Miner’s Manual, we decided to redo the whole Escape menu. The main tab is the Status, where you can read all the information about your current Mission, Loadout, and Team. Many of the items link directly to the Miner’s Manual, so you can learn more about, for instance, the current Mission Warning Mutator with just one click.


VANITY ICONS
----------------------------
All cosmetic items, both from The Shop and The Forge, now have proper icon previews! They are perfect for quick sorting and to avoid “guess forging”, but, most importantly, they look cool.


ARMOR PAINTJOBS [COMMUNITY REQUEST]
----------------------------
All the ingame Armor Sets have received the same split between Frameworks and Paintjobs that weapons got recently. Several brand new Armor Paintjobs can be found in the Lost Pack Encounters, with more to come further down the line.

	Update_32 = "Hello Roughnecks!

It’s finally time for our first major Post-Launch Update! The main dish is two brand-new mission types: Escort Duty and On-site Refining. Both mission types focus on heavy duty mining equipment that needs tender loving care and protection from a team of hard working dwarves! The side dish includes a ton of new cosmetics, further weapon balancing, a much-needed overhaul of the Assignment Board, and many other things. Bon appetit!

It’s time to get greasy! There has never been a better time to be a combat miner working for DRG. See you in the mines!      

With Love,
The Ghost Ship Crew

--- PATCH NOTES ---

NEW MISSION: ON-SITE REFINING
----------------------------
Management has a new thirst: Liquid Morkite. They are sending you in alongside an On-Site Refinery to fill. Locate the Liquid Morkite wells and hook them up to orbital-insertion industrial Pumpjacks, connect them to the refinery by building huge, winding pipelines, and pump those deposits dry! Oh, and the good people down in RnD even felt generous enough to build in a handy way to use the pipelines for quick, easy, and SAFE* traversal.

*Check the clause 3.15 of your contract to read more about the company’s definition of “safe”.


NEW MISSION: ESCORT DUTY
----------------------------
In this heavily combat-focused mission you are sent in to obtain a mysterious Ommoran Heartstone! Only the specially built autonomous Drilldozer can make it through the outer shell of the Ommoran and reveal the prize inside: The priceless Ommoran Heartstone. The Drilldozer will land at a safe distance, and then automatically home in on the Ommoran. Your job is to keep the dang thing safe and fueled as it digs its way towards the objective. Guard it with your life, Miners!


NEW ASSIGNMENT: ROUGHNECKS AT WORK
----------------------------
This new Assignment serves as a crash course in how to safely complete the new missions and make it back alive - and will reward you with some fancy new headwear on completion. What’s not to love?


NEW COSMETICS
----------------------------
Attention, fashion freaks! The new fall collection has just dropped with a beautiful selection of new Beards, Headwear, and Hairdos! 27 new Cosmetics have been added to the Shop, 11 new Cosmetics can be forged with Matrix Cores, and 1 new Headwear will be rewarded by completing the new assignment. 


NEW DLC: ROUGHNECK PACK 
----------------------------
If you really want to rough it up, the new Roughneck Pack has you covered. Spice up your looks with four new sets of unique armor (one per class), new helmets, and new Paintjobs. This pack is squarely aimed at those that can’t be bothered dressing up as a space marine, and just want to get stuck into the hard work at hand! Finally, show off those figurative guns - as well as that choice selection of tattoos you’ve kept under wraps for so long!

On top of the Armors, the pack comes with two unique helmets, as well as a new Paintjob for Bosco and your Pickaxe.


RANDOMIZE COSMETIC IN WARDROBE
----------------------------
Talking about fashion...if you are one of those persons who can’t decide which helmet to wear or how to style your beard or maybe you are just too afraid to try something new and daring, well….we got great news for you: The Wardrobe has been equipped with new Randomize buttons - Full Outfit as well per Category.

In the future we could imagine having you find other tools and weapons that could be used in a similar way.

	Update_16 = "Hello miners! We’re back in the saddle after some lovely summer vacation and have cranked out a new patch for you. In response to all the hot weather we’ve been having, we figured the obvious thing to do was add an ice biome. Right?

--- PATCH NOTES ---

NEW BIOME - GLACIAL STRATA
----------------------------
Brave an all new icy hellscape, complete with unstable and deadly ice spikes in the ceiling, terrifying crevices opening up under your feet, exclusive enemy types, and the first iteration of our all new Temperature system! Play it cool - just be careful you don’t end up as a meat popsicle...

CAVES
- Ice! The main material of the Glacial Strata planetary region is ice instead of rock, so fire melts it! Use this information wisely.
- Deep snow! Look out for piles of it. It won’t harm you, but it’ll slow you down and is  impossible to sprint through.
- Frozen lakes! Watch your step - they’re quite slippery.
- Hot Springs! The only relief from the biting cold, if you disregard the “tools” you carry with you.

FLORA
- Explosive Ice Plants! Use them to freeze aliens in their tracks, but watch yourself...they’re just as likely to hit you as the enemy.
- Platform Plants! Shoot them to release the liquid inside - it will freeze instantly and form useful (but brittle) platforms for you to use.

ENEMIES
- Ice Bomber! A variation of our brand new Mactera Bomber enemy. It’ll release sickening streams of freezing substance as it flies past you.
- Frost Glyphids! Several types of Glyphid have adapted to the cold and will continue to hunt you for your lovely warm flesh even here. And watch out for the Frost Praetorian - it’s a stone cold killer. On the upside, they all seem quite susceptible to heat of any kind…

HAZARDS
- Cold Vents! Watch out for cracks in the walls and telltale horisontal streams of air - occasionally, they’ll let out blasts of bone-chilling wind.
- Thin Ice! Walk carefully and keep your ears peeled. Deep chasms might just open up beneath you at a moment’s notice.
- Unstable Icicles! Keep an eye out for algae-filled icicles in the ceiling. The slightest disturbance tends to make them fall thunderously to the floor and shatter. Woe be to any that stand underneath them at that point.

TEMPERATURE SYSTEM
- While body odour remains low on the list of dwarven priorities, keeping an eye on your body temperature is now more important than ever. Get too low and you’ll get frozen in place. Get too high and you’ll burst into flame. Keeping towards the center of the scale is safest. 
- Certain actions or items will reduce or increase your temperature. Some, such as the flamethrower, is pretty self-explanatory.
- Enemies follow the same rules. They can be both frozen and set on fire, though they’ll have unique resistances or weaknesses depending on their species. FYI: Frozen enemies can be shattered if enough damage are applied to them...

OTHER ADDITIONS / TWEAKS
----------------------------
DISCORD RICH INTEGRATION
- See what your friends are playing and join their game directly from Discord.

ENEMIES
- New Enemy type: Goo Bomber
- The Spitball Infector now starts dormant, and only wakes up if you get too close or it is injured in any way.
- Mactera Spawns have become much weaker to melee attacks.
- Mactera Grabber should no longer scream unless it’s actively chasing you.

BOSCO
- New icon so you always know what Bosco is up to.
- Bosco no longer mine dirt that is closer to the Player than the wall instructed to mine at.
- Bosco now always goes for the Grabber / Cave leech that grabbed the Player.
- Bosco will not revive the Player without being near him/her after getting killed by a Cave leech or Grabber.
- Tweaked Bosco’s priorities - he’ll now focus on the enemies instead of mining when instructed to.
- Optimization while pointing at enemies.

AUDIO
- Tons of new voice lines added.

FIXES
----------------------------
- Fixed Scout IFG Grenade not applying the proper damage resistance penalty.
- Fixed Molly choosing to walk away while someone is depositing. Manners, Molly!
- Improved the way savegames are handled - your savegames are now named after your SteamID to prevent problems when sharing a single machine.
- Backups are now written to seperate files each session to prevent save game corruption from accidentally trashing the backups.
- Fixed an issue with Ziplines where clients could move slightly and increase speed while on the zip line.
- Fixed framerate drop when pointing the laser pointer at Glyphid tunnels and embedded minerals.
- Enemies should no longer continue making sounds after they’re dead. Stands to reason, really…
- Mactera Spawn and Grabber should no longer get stuck outside the Navmesh after dashing.
"
	Update_34 = "Hello, Miners!
We’re back with a modest update for you! Work is proceeding apace for the longer-term goals included in the upcoming Update 35, but with Update 34 we want to sweeten the long waiting time a bit. We got the possibility of double Warnings on missions, two brand new Warnings to add to the mix, a lot of weapon tweaks, and more to keep you busy! It’s time to dive back into the depths of Hoxxes and face the new dangers!

With Love,
The Ghost Ship Crew

--- PATCH NOTES ---

DOUBLE WARNINGS - DOUBLE THE FUN
----------------------------
An innovation committee assigned by management has tried to answer the following question: ‘What novel and unique new initiatives can we introduce to boost company profit?’ After many ideation sessions, workshops, and off-sites, they finally have the answer: Missions with two warnings instead of one!

Gather a team of fellow miners and try your hand at this extreme challenge. Prove that you are the toughest among all miners and that you eat regular Single Warning missions for breakfast. Rock and Stone!
NB! Missions with double warnings are deemed so challenging that they have been excluded from Deep Dives and Assignments.

NEW WARNINGS
----------------------------
New dangers have been discovered in the caves!  

ELITE THREAT
Missions with this Warning will have you encountering elite enemies. Elite enemies are tougher, faster and more dangerous versions of the bugs already know and love. 

SWARMAGEDDON
A tsunami of swarmers awaits you in the mines. Bring plenty of pesticide and bullets! 


CONTROLLER MAPPING
----------------------------
Are you frustrated with the current controller bindings? Do you feel that your mining performance could improve if you could just map the actions differently? Do you want more from your controller experience? Have we got some news for you! With the new option to rebind actions on your controller, you can finally get the unique layout that is just right for you.


IMPROVED BULLET TRACING
----------------------------
How shooting is handled in terms of networking has been remarkably optimized. The result should be a more instantaneous response when firing projectiles. And projectiles now use much less bandwidth!


SAVE GAME PROFILES
----------------------------
Now you have the option to manage different save game profiles if you’re playing with mods (or for any other reason of your choosing) so you can have a separate save for messing around. This feature was originally planned as a part of a larger modding support solution for this update, but we decided to postpone it and release it separately later. We are planning a more comprehensive and improved solution for letting mods into the main game and we will reveal more details as this project progresses. Stay tuned!

	Update_34_Xbox = "Hello, Miners!
We’re back with a modest update for you! Work is proceeding apace for the longer-term goals included in the upcoming Update 35, but with Update 34 we want to sweeten the long waiting time a bit. We got the possibility of double Warnings on missions, two brand new Warnings to add to the mix, a lot of weapon tweaks, and more to keep you busy! It’s time to dive back into the depths of Hoxxes and face the new dangers!

With Love,
The Ghost Ship Crew

--- PATCH NOTES ---

DOUBLE WARNINGS - DOUBLE THE FUN
----------------------------
An innovation committee assigned by management has tried to answer the following question: ‘What novel and unique new initiatives can we introduce to boost company profit?’ After many ideation sessions, workshops, and off-sites, they finally have the answer: Missions with two warnings instead of one!

Gather a team of fellow miners and try your hand at this extreme challenge. Prove that you are the toughest among all miners and that you eat regular Single Warning missions for breakfast. Rock and Stone!
NB! Missions with double warnings are deemed so challenging that they have been excluded from Deep Dives and Assignments.

NEW WARNINGS
----------------------------
New dangers have been discovered in the caves!  

ELITE THREAT
Missions with this Warning will have you encountering elite enemies. Elite enemies are tougher, faster and more dangerous versions of the bugs already know and love. 

SWARMAGEDDON
A tsunami of swarmers awaits you in the mines. Bring plenty of pesticide and bullets! 


CONTROLLER MAPPING
----------------------------
Are you frustrated with the current controller bindings? Do you feel that your mining performance could improve if you could just map the actions differently? Do you want more from your controller experience? Have we got some news for you! With the new option to rebind actions on your controller, you can finally get the unique layout that is just right for you.


IMPROVED BULLET TRACING
----------------------------
How shooting is handled in terms of networking has been remarkably optimized. The result should be a more instantaneous response when firing projectiles. And projectiles now use much less bandwidth!


SAVE GAME PROFILES
----------------------------
Now you have the option to manage different save game profiles if you’re playing with mods (or for any other reason of your choosing) so you can have a separate save for messing around. This feature was originally planned as a part of a larger modding support solution for this update, but we decided to postpone it and release it separately later. We are planning a more comprehensive and improved solution for letting mods into the main game and we will reveal more details as this project progresses. Stay tuned!

	Update_12 = "Hey Miners!

It’s patch time again, and we have a bunch of cool new stuff for you! Tweaks, bug fixes, and the first new enemy! Also, along with these smaller updates, we are now initiating some larger content and feature development. More on this later, when we reveal a larger roadmap of things to come. 

--- PATCH NOTES ---

COMMUNITY REQUESTED FIXES
-----------------------------------------------------

BOSCO JOINS YOU IF YOU START A HOSTED GAME ALONE
A very popular request from the community has been for Bosco to accompany you when you start hosting a game. This way you can start mining with Bosco assisting you, while you wait for your friends or strangers to join your game. We have done a rough first implementation with no bells and whistles, and it works like this:
- Bosco joins you when you start hosting a public/ private game and head in alone.
- When the first a player joins your game, Bosco will self-destruct for that game session.

JADIZ BUFF
Jadiz has been one of the hardest crafting materials to collect and we have buffed it. Jadiz will now spawn a bit more often in Crystalline Caverns Region and we have changed the value range of it from 7-18 to 10-18. 

WANT NICE CLEAN SCREEN SHOTS? 
Some of you have been requesting been able to take nice clean screenshot and we actually also need that feature! Now you can Hold [H] to toggle the HUD on/off. 


NEW STUFF
-----------------------------------------------------

NEW ENEMY: SAY HELLO TO THE MACTERA SPAWN! 
The Mactera Spawn is our first proper flying enemy. It will attack from a distance using its vomit attack. Smack that Fly!

SWARMER TUNNELS 
You can now come across strangely looking small tunnels coming out of the walls. Glyphid Swarmers live here! They are very territorial and will aggressively defend their nest! A simple advice: Avoid them!  

CAVE LEECH LETS YOU GO “GENTLY” WHEN IT DIES! 
Previously, when a dwarf was dropped from a dying Cave Leech, he might drop for a long distance, mysteriously taking no fall damage, which was as designed but seemed weird. Now the Cave Leech slackens its’ tongue and lowers you down more gently, making it seem more realistic that you don’t take fall damage.

DESTRUCTIBLE ARMOR ON GLYPHIDS!
Direct enough firepower to those pesky armor plates to shoot them off and expose the soft underbits underneath!

NEW PASSIVE CREATURE: IS IT A PLANE? IS IT A BIRD? NO IT‘S A FLYING JELLYFISH! 
The Dense Biozone region of Hoxxes is now inhabited by large, passive, flying jellies.

MINERAL TRADE TERMINAL 
In the Mineral Trade Terminal you can trade your credits for crafting materials, but be advised that materials are priced fairly exorbitantly. You can also sell your precious crafting materials for credits, but again don’t expect a fair price. Deep Rock Galactic are always trying to maximize their income even if it comes from its workers! 

REVOLVER RELOAD ANIMATION
The Gunner’s Revolver now has a proper reload animation - as well as a cool gunslinger move when you try the reload while it’s fully reloaded.  

FLASHLIGHT NERF 
Range on the dwarves’ flashlights has been tweaked down from 12.50m to 11.00m, making them a bit weaker.

PATHFINDER IMPROVEMENTS
Enemies are now less likely to go straight through thin cave walls.

M.U.L.E. SAFETY FIX
If for some reason the MULE does not find its way back to the Escape Pod, the doors will still open 15 seconds before countdown runs out.  

...And tons of minor stuff, mostly bug-fixes behind the scenes, but also small visual upgrades. For full overview see the patch notes below.

--- PATCH NOTES ---

COMMUNITY REQUESTED FIXES
-----------------------------------------------------

LESS SHIELD
Some of you hardcore miners have been requesting that the game was harder - especially on higher difficulties. We have tried to make tweaks that makes the game harder on higher difficulties, but feel almost the same on lower difficulties. We have lowered your starting shield from 30 to 25 and changed the shield upgrades to the shield from 10 to 2.5 (giving a 10% boost).

MORE HEALTH
To compensate for the lack of shield - we’ve increased player health from 100 to 110 hp. 

MORE RED SUGAR
Furthermore the amount of healing you get from red sugar has been increased 25% and the amount of red sugar spawned in a mission has been increased by 10%. 


TWEAKS 
-----------------------------------------------------

SOLO ENEMY NUMBERS & HEALTH
Exploring the caves of Hoxxes by yourself takes more time and can be brutal, so we have made it so the swarms will be a little bit smaller when you are on your own. Enemy health has also been lowered a little bit for solo expeditions. The creatures of Hoxxes are still dangerous so don’t drop your guard!  

BOSCO NOW WITH 50% MORE REVIVES
While he really wants to, Bosco can’t always save you from a cave leech. He feels really bad about it and has requested that he be allowed to revive you 3 times instead of 2. The request has been granted.

MACTERA SPAWN HEALTH INCREASED
In a continuing effort to perfect the Mactera Spawn we have changed its health from 180 to 210. Remember to use cover and aim for the weak-spot!
"
	Update_25 = "Hi Miners,
Whew! You’ve been patient with us for a long while, but Update 25 - our most ambitious update to date - is finally here! Deep Dives, even more gear customization, late-game rewards, tons of new skins, cargo crates, overhauled beard physics...hoh boy, Miners - this is a big one. Our beards grew 6 inches just from writing these patch notes.


--- PATCH NOTES ---

DEEP DIVES
----------------------------
If you’re a Dwarf that’s looking to go places, we have just the opportunity for you. As a promoted Dwarf you have been deemed worthy to get special access to weekly Deep Dives - three consecutive seeded missions, where ammunition and health carries over to the next mission. In Deep Dives you will have to complete two objectives in each stage and chances for encountering Mutators are very high. Each of the three stages of a Deep Dive will grant you rewards upon completion, ranging from minerals to the new Matrix Cores. While you can complete the week’s Deep Dives as many times as you want and improve your best time, bear in mind the rewards can only be claimed once per week.


MATRIX CORES
----------------------------
Not getting paid enough? We’re giving your Deep Rock Galactic pay-slip a boost. Matrix Cores are the cornerstones of the new rewards introduced in  Deep Rock Galactic. In Update 25 you will receive Infused Matrix Cores - Matrix Cores with already predefined content, that can be used to forge Weapon Overclocks or glorious all-new beards and helmets. In Update 26 we will introduce a way to infuse Blank Matrix Cores, but more on that when we get closer.


THE FORGE
----------------------------
The place where you go with you Infused Matrix Core and forge them into something usefull. Also note that forging Infused Matrix Cores will increase your Forging Mastery and earn you even more Matrix Cores. It’s Hammertime! 


WEAPON OVERCLOCK CORES
----------------------------
If you’ve been wanting bigger explosions or new ways to shred entire tunnels of bloodthirsty glyphids, then you’ll love the upgrades you’ll be unlocking for your arsenal. Weapon Overclocks range from basic but minor improvements like increase magazine capacity, to providing entirely new ways to modify the overall weapon functionality. 
Deal radioactive splash damage with your Grenade Launcher? There’s an overclock for that. Gain more airtime while aiming down the sights of the M1000 rifle? There’s an overclock for that. Shred the enemies with ice shards from your Cryo Cannon? You guessed it. There’s an overclock for that.


COSMETIC CORES
----------------------------
With Update 25, we’re doubling down on glorious facial hair and other cosmetic items. If you thought your current beard was the most dwarven it could get... boy, do we have some hairy news for you.


NEW ASSIGNMENTS
----------------------------
BREACH THE CORE: Upon your first promotion of any dwarf you get access to a new assignment called BREACH THE CORE. Complete this to earn a handful of Infused Matrix Cores and get your collection of Weapon Overclocks and Rare Cosmetics kick-started. Completing the assignment will also unlock the Weekly Core Hunt.  


WEEKLY CORE HUNT: For those veteran dwarves looking to make a little spare cash for beard accessories on the side, there’s now Weekly Core Hunt assignments available for Promoted Dwarves. Finishing these will reward you both a Weapon Overclock Core and a Cosmetic Core. Stay strong and classy.


CARGO CRATES
----------------------------
It’s not all about the Deep Dives, though. Be on the lookout for lost Cargo Crates in the caves of normal missions - they are known to contain copious amounts of minerals and weapon skins!


NEW MUTATORS
----------------------------

WARNINGS
----------------------------
LOW OXYGEN: As the title says - hold your breath and try not to die before you reach an oxygen tank.

LETHAL ENEMIES: The aliens are extra cranky today. All enemies deal significantly more damage.

REGENERATIVE BUGS: I’ll have what they’re having. All enemies regenerate their health if you wound them and don’t take them out straight away.

PARASITES: Well, it gets even worse. The aliens in this place are just… ugh… just full of angry, parasitic worms. 

HAUNTED CAVE: There’s… SOMETHING… in this cave. It is hunting you. Relentlessly. And it just...won’t...die! Don’t stop. Don’t look behind you. It’s right there constantly coming for you.

ANOMALIES
----------------------------
VOLATILE GUTS: You thought Exploder Infestation was bad? Well, whatever infested those poor creatures has run rampant here. Every alien explodes. Just awful.


BEARD PHYSICS
----------------------------
Glorious facial hair is the hallmark of a good dwarf. We’ve added enhanced beard physics to enhance that magnificent feeling of having a proper dwarven beard.


MORE DWARVEN SHOUTS
----------------------------
Nothing is more dwarvish than yelling at stuff, so we’ve added a whole new range of voice lines to the mix. There are new shouts for Power Attacks, salutes, grenade throws, laser pointer, and lots more.  


BIOMES
----------------------------
- New dripping rainfall effect. It can often occur in Dense Biozone and rarely in Crystalline Caverns. 
- Moving through deep snow in Glacial Strata is less of a slog now - you should notice a significant boost in movement speed.


BULLET TRAILS
----------------------------
They make weapon spread, recoil, and other features more visible so the effect of certain Mods and Overclocks is clearly noticeable. Plus, we also think they look neat.


NO MORE “FLOATING ISLANDS”
----------------------------
Strange anomalies were causing gravity-defying behaviour where crystals, dirt, and other biome elements were floating when separated from their anchor points. They no longer do that. No more getting stuck on tiny little bits of floating rock after digging!


CUSTOMIZABLE HUD
----------------------------
Less is sometimes more. There is a whole slew of new options for HUD customization, letting you set up what’s shown and what isn’t completely to your liking - including dynamic options to make elements appear when they are relevant and disappear when they are not.


INTERPLANETARY MINERS UNION
----------------------------
The Interplanetary Miners Union has finally made its way to Hoxxes IV for Discord users. By joining one of the three Union Chapters, you can work towards both specific chapter goals and a collective goal. There are Union sanctioned rewards to collect!


THROW LIKE AN ATHLETE
----------------------------
Being a miner demands precision in every aspect, and so we’ve added a new throwing mechanic to the game. Click to let go of a held object, hold down to charge your throw with the desired amount of force.

	Update_25_Xbox = "Hi Miners,
Whew! You’ve been patient with us for a long while, but Update 25 - our most ambitious update to date - is finally here! Deep Dives, even more gear customization, late-game rewards, tons of new skins, cargo crates, overhauled beard physics...hoh boy, Miners - this is a big one. Our beards grew 6 inches just from writing these patch notes.


--- PATCH NOTES ---

DEEP DIVES
----------------------------
If you’re a Dwarf that’s looking to go places, we have just the opportunity for you. As a promoted Dwarf you have been deemed worthy to get special access to weekly Deep Dives - three consecutive seeded missions, where ammunition and health carries over to the next mission. In Deep Dives you will have to complete two objectives in each stage and chances for encountering Mutators are very high. Each of the three stages of a Deep Dive will grant you rewards upon completion, ranging from minerals to the new Matrix Cores. While you can complete the week’s Deep Dives as many times as you want and improve your best time, bear in mind the rewards can only be claimed once per week.

	Update_11 = "Hi Miners, 

We have another update for you with some cool new features, some tweaks and some bug fixes. Along with these smaller updates, we are now initiating some larger content and feature development. More on this later, when we reveal a larger roadmap of things to come. 

--- PATCH NOTES ---

COMMUNITY REQUESTED FIXES 
--------------------------------------------
GUNNER: GATLING GUN REWORK
There’s a been a lot of talk about the Gatling Gun being too weak especially on higher difficulties. We agree, and we have made a bunch of tweaks to it:
- Starting Ammo Capacity changed from 1800 to 1600 rounds.
- It is now fed ammo continuously from a single, upgradeable ammo drum - no more reloading!
- Overheats slightly faster - tweaked from 10 seconds of continuous fire to 9.
- Overheating is more punishing - time to cool down raised from 8 seconds to 10
- Upgrades reworked: Upgrades involving ammo and clip increase have now been made to only focus on the clip size. First upgrade originally gave you +400 bullets to max ammo it has been changed to +400 to clipsize. Second clip upgrade will give you a total boost of +400 bullets where it before only increased the clipsize. Resulting in the Gatling Gun packing impressive 2400 bullets when maxed out!  
- New Tungsten Bullet upgrade for Gatling Gun has been added allowing you to boost the damage 25%. A mandatory upgrade for players with affinity for Extreme difficulty.
- Added smoke effect to make it more obvious when you overheats

A BETTER BOSCO
If you pointed at a really tiny chunk of unmined minerals Bosco would go there and not find the tiny chunk then abort the task. Now he can find the chunk and dig it. Bosco is also much better at not sneaking up in front of you when you are mining. All quality of life fixes to you favorite drone!


NEW STUFF
--------------------------------------------
TEAM CAMS LET YOU STAY IN THE ACTION
1st iteration of Team Cams - Keep an eye on your teammates are doing while you are incapacitated. Now it is less of a downer being down! 

ELECTRO CRYSTALS
Deadly Electro Crystals have been added to Crystal Caverns. Don’t get too close - they pack a punch!

PLATFORMS PROHIBITED IN DROP POD  
Platforms (and Supply Pods) can not spawn/ attach to drop pod anymore. We get it... some off you had fun filling up the Drop Pod with platforms, but Management reminds you that Platform Concrete is notoriously hard to clean out!

GRAVITY RECALIBRATION
A temptingly tantalizing button called “Gravity Recalibration” has been activated on the Space Rig. Management will likely frown on employees abusing it - but it’s so big and red...

FIXED STEAM REGION SEARCH
Before some people had a hard time finding games in their own region. We have fixed this now (we hope)!

...And tons of minor stuff, mostly bug-fixes behind the scenes, but also small visual upgrades. For full overview see the patch notes below.

--- PATCH NOTES ---

COMMUNITY REQUESTED FIXES

Believe it or not, Deep Rock Galactic has now been live for ONE WHOLE YEAR. We launched into EARLY ACCESS on the 28th of February 2018, and that means it’s celebration-time with this mini-update! Developing the game and expanding it with new features and content has been (and continues to be) an absolute blast, and we are very humbled by all the great feedback and reviews we’ve been getting from you. Thank you all for helping us turn Deep Rock Galactic into what we believe is an AWESOME game, and for being part of this wonderful community. Three cheers for you guys, for the future, and for ROCK AND STONE!

Much love,

--- PATCH NOTES ---

ONE YEAR CELEBRATION GOODIES
-----------------------------------
SPACE RIG DRESSING: The Space Rig has been decorated and is ready for your party!

ONE YEAR CELEBRATION HAT: Pick up your Time Limited ONE YEAR CELEBRATION HAT at the Gear Shop! It’s dirt cheap!* 
*It obviously lives up to the same high bar of quality you’ve come to expect from DRG equipment.

HAPPY HOUR IN THE ABYSS BAR - ALL DAY LONG: All beverages at the Abyss Bar are half off for the celebration, courtesy of DRG Management. Drink responsibly, and do remember that your Workers’ Comp does not cover injury while operating heavy mining machinery when intoxicated!


UPGRADED SUPPORTER UPGRADE 
-----------------------------------
We’ve wanted to add more content to the game’s Supporter Upgrade for a long time, and what better occasion to do so than the One Year Anniversary! Here are the new goodies that current and new owners have in store:

SUPPORTER WEAPON SKINS
Gilded Supporter skins for the weapons for all characters!

A VERY SPECIAL GHOST SHIP GAMES HELMET
This supporter helmet might be a little too old school for space, but it sure makes you look cool!  

SPECIAL SUPPORTER GLYPHID SLAMMER
Serving one of our Supporters is always a pleasure! As a Supporter, you will get special treatment when ordering Glyphid Slammers at the Abyss Bar. 

BETTER SUPPORTER SHOW-OFF IN TEXT-CHAT
Supporters now get their name and supporter icon displayed in blue when using the text-chat. Developers get their names displayed in green if you should be so lucky as to play with one :-) 


WEEKLY ASSIGNMENTS
-----------------------------------
Weekly Assignments are a new addition to the Assignment system where a new Assignment is generated each week for you to complete. Complete it and earn a hefty cache of credits and minerals.


MORE HEADWEAR
-----------------------------------
Snappy Beret for your Gunner? Check. A nice, warm Beanie to cover up that bald, freezing head? Double check. A pig-iron mohawk or iron plates bolted to your skull? We got you covered. Thirteen new headwears have been added for you to look fancy in the dark.


FIXES FOR BET-C 
-----------------------------------
- A light ring displays the area of effect of BET-C’s grenades. 
- BET-C’s friendly fire damage (once converted, that is) has been reduced. Now BET-C feels a bit more like a trusty companion than before.
- Improvements to BET-C’s friendly movement behavior, in an effort to make her stop sitting on top of the player.


SERVER LIST UI IMPROVEMENTS
-----------------------------------
The server list has gotten a beefy overhaul, for an overall better overview of the different active games. We’ve improved the filtering options, and added tooltips to better explain the different icons.


CAVE GENERATION UPDATE
-----------------------------------
More structures have been added to the cave generator which will result in a greater variety of levels in all mission types. Additionally, improvements to the underlying systems means you should see more variations out of the existing cave shapes as well.


MISC.
-----------------------------------
- Fixed an issue the screen would flash white throughout gameplay, on GTX 970/980 graphics cards
- New animation for checking the Terrain Scanner

--- PATCH NOTES ---

GRENADE LOADOUT
-----------------------------------
The boys and gals in R&D have been hard at work once more! All the old grenades have been reworked, and a ton of new ones have been added. Each class can now unlock up to three distinct types of class-specific throwables, with the potential for more to come in future Updates.
- Engineer: L.U.R.E, Plasma Burster, Proximity Mine
- Gunner: Sticky Grenade, Incendiary Grenade, Cluster Grenade
- Scout: IFG, Cryo Grenade, Pheromone Canister
- Driller: Impact Axe, HE Grenade, Neurotoxin Grenade


LOADING SCREEN MAKEOVER
-----------------------------------
We’ve finally gotten our new orbital drone cameras installed, enabling much better and varied scenic views of mining crews descending to the surface of Hoxxes at the beginning of each mission.


END SCREEN MAKEOVER
-----------------------------------
The End Screen shown at the end of each mission has gotten a much-needed overhaul as well. Now you get to pose and display all your lovely cosmetics in full 3D while the mission data ticks up!


NEW MOBS
-----------------------------------
NAEDOCYTE BREEDER
Imagine a floating bag of slime, constantly spewing out pulsing egg-sacks full of ravenous young. They may look like gentle giants (depending on how much you like tentacles), but trust us when we say you want to take these oozing blimps out quick.

NAEDOCYTE HATCHLING
The result of leaving the Naedocyte Breeders to do their thing. We’ve run into more developed varieties of these before, but this is the first time we’ve ever encountered them in their larval state. They are hatched ravenously hungry, so mind yourselves that you don’t get overrun.

Q’RONAR YOUNGLINGS
Younger and softer variation of the Shellbacks. Unlike their more solitary-minded mature state, the Q’ronar Younglings hunt in packs. Do not underestimate them.

GOLDEN LOOTBUG
Now, this is an interesting one. Unlike the common Lootbug, this particular breed gorge themselves on gold alone. Management has no qualms with employees taking them out for sport and personal gain. 

HUULI HOARDER
This rare beastie seems like a bit of an oddity among the otherwise mostly hostile Hoxxes fauna. Often referred to as “The Clown Car”, the Huuli Hoarder is an abject coward and will run away from any potential threat once startled. However, like the common Lootbug, they subside solely on a diet of precious minerals - as in, taking them out will net you a tidy profit, just take care that you don’t let it separate you from your team.


LATE JOIN DROP POD
-----------------------------------
[COMMUNITY REQUEST] Let it not be said that Management does not care about employee complaints. Joining a mission already in progress now dumps you into a personal drop pod, letting you safely land in the mission area instead of utilizing the horribly unreliable teleportation technology used so far. As with the Supply Pod, it is recommended to keep a safe distance to the landing zone. 


BETTER DISCORD INTEGRATION
-----------------------------------
Sign up for the Miner’s Union and join our wonderful Discord community directly from the Space Rig! We have bigger plans for this down the line, but for now, you can use it to see the number of active members and such.

UI AND CONTROLS

- [COMMUNITY REQUEST] Added option to disable Mouse Smoothing

MODELS AND AUDIO
-----------------------------------
- New Heavy Sentry model for Engineers

Howdy Miners! 
Time to put on your brand new armor sets, drink beers with buffs and take on new exciting assignments. Oktoberfest is over and we have been busy packing a big bag of cool features for you. Enjoy! 

--- PATCH NOTES ---

NEW ASSIGNMENT SYSTEM
----------------------------
Our goal with the assignment system is to create a smoother start for new players and at the same time create excitement for getting access to new content. Assignments in the future will be used to unlock new content like alternative weapons and planet regions.

THE PROBATIONARY PERIOD:
When you start the game for the first time you now have to complete the Probationary Period in order to prove your worth as a miner. The Probationary Period is a 9-missions long assignment and will take you through the different regions of Hoxxes and challenge you with various missions to complete.   

You can join any missions on the server list, regardless of completion of the Probationary Period. Completing missions that is part of an assignment grants you bonus rewards in the form of crafting materials and credits. After completing the Probationary Period you will have unlocked all regions, missions, and difficulties. 

ATTENTION VETERAN MINERS! Players who have played the game before will get an option to skip the Probationary Period from The Assignment Board terminal. 


RETIREMENT
----------------------------
RETIREMENT APPLICATION: When you max out a character at level 20, you get the option to complete the Retirement Application Assignment for that character. Select it from the Assignment Board Terminal. When you have completed the assignment you get the option to retire that character from the Character Selection Terminal. 

RETIRING A DWARF: When you retire a character that character will reset to level 1 and you will lose all progress on weapons and upgrades for that character. You will, however, keep all progression on perks, credits, crafting materials, and vanity items. The first time you retire, you will also unlock an extra perk slot for that specific character. Retiring a character is the only way you can increase your player rank above 26, since you need to gain character levels in order to gain player ranks. We are also considering to introduce unlocks of vanity and other features for players above player rank 26.


MISSION UPDATES
----------------------------
In order to make a smooth Probationary Period assignment, and in general to improve the long-term mining experience, we have tweaked some of the missions and made both simpler and more complex versions of them. 

EGG HUNT: We have for a long time been wanting to improve the missions types Egg Hunt and Search & Extract. In the end, we decided to just merge them together. Here are the changes:

- Egg hunt now takes place in a cave system, similar to what you used to encounter in Search & Extract. 
- Instead of having to run around and search for the eggs you can use the Terrain Scanner (hold down [M]) to spot their location. 
- You have to collect fewer eggs than previously. 
- Egg hunt now has multiple complexities and lengths. 
- Search & Extract have been removed for now.
- We resisted the temptation of calling Egg Hunt for Search & Eggstract!

SALVAGE MISSION
- The cave systems can now generate both medium and high complexity levels
- Length short (Assemble 2 MINI MULES) and long (Assemble 3 MINI MULES) 

ELIMINATION
- The cave systems can now generate both medium and high complexity levels
- Length short (Kill 2 Dreadnoughts) and long (Kill 3 Dreadnoughts) 


BEER BUFFS
----------------------------
Buffs have been added to some of the beers and prices have been adjusted: 

- RED ROCK BLASTER: +30% to max health
- SKULLCRUSHER ALE: +50% Pickaxe damage
- DARK MORKITE: +20% Morkite mined
- GLYPHID SLAMMER: A new none-buff beer, but it will still make you happy :-)

Beers with buffs have been given a lower potency effect, so you can drink one without getting drunk. This is done to prevent you from always having to drink the Leaf Lover’s Special if you don’t want to play with the drunk effect on.

Note that Buffs will remain after drinking Leaf Lover’s Special. And also note that Buffs won’t stack. Also-also note that beers have some randomness in how hard they affect you.  


NEW MODEL FOR ASSAULT RIFLE
----------------------------
Scouts assault rifle has gotten an overhaul of model, animations, and sound. 


NEW ARMORS
----------------------------
8 new Armors (called MK3 Basic and Heavy) have been implemented, ready for you to buy and equip. They will be unlocked at player rank 10 and 12 respectively. if you are lower than player rank 8 you will only see the MK2 armor in the shop.


DIFFICULTY TWEAK
----------------------------
Hazard levels for 2-player games have been tweaked to make the jump from playing solo to two players less steep. Scaling factors of enemies for 2-player games have been adjusted like this: Low risk 0.4 to 0.3, Challenging 0.5 to 0.4, Dangerous 0.75 to 0.66, Extreme 1.0 to 0.9 

The Mactera Plague warning has been tweaked down in difficulty. Some craziness is still ensured, but now it should be less punishing. 


FIXES AND IMPROVEMENTS
----------------------------
- New dance move when listening to the jukebox
- Zip-line fix. Now clients also get forward momentum when jumping off the zip-line
- Save files are not overwritten if there is no connection to steam
- Server List is added on Xbox! Now it should be a lot easier to find a team to play with! 
- We have disabled that you can drop a carried item by pressing [E]/ (X). If you want to drop a carried item either toggle weapons or throw it by pressing [LEFT MOUSE BUTTON]/ (RIGHT TRIGGER)
- Using Terrain Scanner no longer spins the player around and the Escape Pod has been added to it
- Third person flamethrower gunsling added
- Fix recoil. It was added before the shot was fired, so you could never be fully accurate
- Fix a case where clients are unable to load the map. Resulting in stuck on loading screen
- Detect chunks and gems falling out of the world and beam them back
- Space Rig - No more blue light in drop pod when launching a mission
- Oktoberfest banner changed
- Save Game: Players can no longer gain extra XP above the cap
- Added mission stats: Total beverages consumed & Total beverage round ordered
- Full Screen mode is now handled correctly and does not reset in between sessions
- Sun added behind Planet Hoxxes in Space Rig. Planet model slightly updated as well
- Clients can now open the mission map while in a hosted game

Hello Miners!
It’s the first Update of 2021, and we got some spicy stuff for you! This time we got two entirely new Planetary Regions for you to explore - the mysterious wonders of the AZURE WEALD, and the thorn-infested hell of HOLLOW BOUGH. Update 33 also includes all new Mactera variations, and several new strains of horrible Glyphid Dreadnought mutations. And then of course there’s the usual slew of other goodies - read more below for the full picture!

With Love,
The Ghost Ship Crew

--- PATCH NOTES ---

NEW BIOME: AZURE WEALD
----------------------------
The Azure Weald is a chilly place, every bit as hostile as the rest of Hoxxes IV - but still, we cannot deny it is oddly beautiful. Dazzling, bioluminescent clusters of lichen light up the darkness, illuminating this fertile and overgrown Region in flickering neon colors. Don't let that lull you into a false sense of security, however - the Azure Weald brings to mind the deep jungle, in all its splendor and horror - and much like its terrestrial counterparts, it is absolutely not out to make friends. Kill or be killed - this is the law in this place.


NEW BIOME: HOLLOW BOUGH
----------------------------
Hollow Bough is a biological oddity that has the Science Department scratching their heads - this entire region of the planet is dominated by colossal, organic conglomerations resembling the inside of hollow trees. However, these structures are under attack by an invasive species of voracious vine-like plants, as much a threat to us as the planet itself. We recommend traversing these environs with extreme caution. The deep, dark folds of wood and bark house much more than a first glance let on.


NEW MILESTONES 
----------------------------
New biomes means new Milestones - one set for Azure Weald and one for Hollow Bough.


MISSION OVERHAUL: ELIMINATION 
----------------------------
It’s Dawn of the Dread down there! Multiple reports have come in from teams finding Dreadnought Cocoons that are further progressed in their metamorphosis than previously encountered. While there are no external markers on the cocoons to show that they are different, the things waiting patiently inside certainly are. So far two confirmed Dreadnought variants have been encountered but disturbing as this is, R&D ensures us that we are fortunate to have found them now and not later when the metamorphosis might be closer to completion.

DREADNOUGHT HIVEGUARD
Completely covered with unbreakable armor, this variant of the Dreadnought is immune to all damage, exposing it’s vulnerable areas only briefly while enraged. To make matters worse, the Hiveguard can call reinforcements to aid it in battle, hence the name. The Glyphid Sentinels that answer this battle call are unlike any we have ever seen. We have no idea where they are coming from but they are both fast and tough. R&D recommends engaging the Dreadnought Hiveguard with great caution and a lot of ammunition.

DREADNOUGHT ARBALEST AND LACERATOR
Question: What’s worse than one Glyphid Dreadnought? Answer: Two Glyphid Dreadnoughts. It would appear that a Cocooned Dreadnought can split in two during metamorphosis. The two monsters - the Arbalest and Lacerator - are both quite different from the original and from each other, displaying wholly unique behaviors. They would be bad enough on their own, but together they pose an immense threat - able to attack from multiple directions and varying ranges at once, while also displaying extreme mobility. Luckily, their shells are softer than that of a regular Dreadnought, allowing damage to pass through from any angle. R&D insists that this apparent weakness is only due to the untimely opening of the cocoon.


MISSION OVERHAUL: SALVAGE 
----------------------------
LOCATING MINE M.U.L.E. LEGS:
It’s been a bit of a rollercoaster but we have finally fixed the issues with locating all the legs needed to fix the Mini M.U.L.E.s. We’ve taken this opportunity to also tweak the gameplay around it to better match our original vision. Now you can interact with a broken M.U.L.E. to download the locations of it’s missing legs to your terrain scanner. No more searching high and low for that last leg. 

CONNECT FUEL CELLS TO DROP POD: 
Update 32 came with a bunch of new tech that we were more than happy to add to existing missions. Exactly how the fuel made it from the fuel cells to the drop pod has always been a bit of a mystery, but not any more! Now in just a few easy steps you can connect a fuel-line between the two, similar to how you build pipelines in the On Site Refining mission.


MISSION OVERHAUL: POINT EXTRACTION
----------------------------
After the release of Update 32 with its shiny new machines, the old Minehead really began to show its age, so we decided it’s about time for an update of the model to match the raised standard. We hope you like it. 


NEW ENEMIES
----------------------------
MACTERA TRI-JAW
A new type of Mactera has been spotted in the depths. More cautious than its brethren, the Tri-Jaw tends to hang further back while delivering a triple barrage of projectiles. Make no mistake, it is a deadly thing, and should be exterminated with extreme prejudice.

MACTERA BRUNDLE
Reports have been coming in of an armoured Mactera variant spotted flying in the swarm. These tough cookies can survive many attacks that would outright kill their more fragile cousins and they keep their vulnerable abdomens covered most of the time.

DEEPTORA BOUGH WASP
A distant cousin of the Deeptora has been spotted living in the folds and nooks of the Hollow Bough. Like their sand-dwelling cousins, the Bough Wasps are extremely territorial and will swarm any intruder that stray too close to their nest.

STABBER VINE
Hollow Bough is full of creepy stuff but none is as dangerous as the Stabber Vine. Plant or animal, the jury is still out on this one, it is very aggressive and persistent in it’s assault. Any dwarf foolish enough to stray too close will be repeatedly attacked by it’s stabbing vines. Keep your eyes peeled for it’s tell-tale spike as most of its body is difficult to distinguish from the mass of the relatively harmless red vines that infest the area.


NEW JUKEBOX CONTENT
----------------------------
Some content creators have experienced copyright claims from music in the jukebox. So far we have tried to spot fix the problem by removing tunes that caused this problem, but now we have a better solution. We have produced 8 new “safe” tracks which are the only ones you will hear when you tick off STREAMER MODE: DISABLE COPYRIGHTED JUKEBOX MUSIC in the option menu. Those 8 tunes are of course also available to everyone in the “normal” Jukebox. This solution has also enabled us to bring back previously removed tunes.

Furthermore we have added a bunch of new dance moves. So it’s time to kill it on the dance floor!


STEAM AWARD AWARD HELMET 
----------------------------
In celebration of our Steam Award nomination and our amazing community that made it possible, we would like to present to you a fancy new helmet: The Horned Marauder. Just because you deserve it!


OVERHAUL OF MINERAL TRADE
----------------------------
The Mineral Trade menu was deemed ready for an update by management. It’s now more intuitive than ever and daily deals have been added. Once per day you can now benefit from an extra good deal (as in, not so bad deal!)l. 
 

M.U.L.E. DOCKING
----------------------------
Some long overdue polish on the docking of the M.U.L.E. is coming. No more jittery flapping about, Molly now has her own spot on the Drop Pod with a fancy electro-magnetic crane for loading and unloading.


SAVE DORETTA
----------------------------
Since almost the first test of the Escort Mission on our experimental branch players have been requesting for a way to save Doretta. It’s something many here at GSG have wanted as well and we are happy to announce that you no longer have to leave Doretta all alone in the dark. While it is not viable to return the bulk of the Drilldozer back to the Space Rig, kind dwarves can now grab Doretta’s head and carry it with them to the escape pod.

Don’t expect any reward! Management really doesn't care! 


Weapon Balancing
----------------------------
Nothing this update as we have been too busy making the two new biomes and new enemies to do any meaningful weapon balancing.


COMMUNITY REQUEST
----------------------------
[COMMUNITY REQUEST] You can now select audio output source and input source separately in-game
[COMMUNITY REQUEST] Games with Friends can now be sorted in the Server List
